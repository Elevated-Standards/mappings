# Add Support for Custom Mapping Overrides

**Task ID:** duC7jztyvdfSbnELYGCQP3
**Component:** 1.2: Column Mapping Engine
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** Medium

## Overview

Allow users to override automatic mappings with custom configurations, enabling manual corrections and organization-specific mapping rules while maintaining the benefits of automated detection.

## Objectives

- Enable manual override of automatic column mappings
- Support organization-specific mapping rules
- Maintain override persistence and versioning
- Provide user-friendly override management interface
- Ensure override validation and conflict resolution

## Technical Requirements

### Override Types
1. **Column Name Overrides**
   - Map specific column names to target fields
   - Support regex patterns for flexible matching
   - Priority-based override resolution

2. **Document-Specific Overrides**
   - Per-document type customizations
   - Template-specific mapping rules
   - Version-specific overrides

3. **Organization Overrides**
   - Company-wide mapping preferences
   - Department-specific rules
   - Role-based override permissions

4. **Temporary Overrides**
   - Session-specific mappings
   - One-time corrections
   - Batch processing overrides

### Core Functionality
1. **Override Management**
   - Create, update, delete override rules
   - Import/export override configurations
   - Validation of override rules

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Priority-based rule application
   - Conflict detection and reporting
   - Fallback to automatic mapping

3. **Override Persistence**
   - Database storage for override rules
   - Version control for rule changes
   - Audit trail for override modifications

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct MappingOverride {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub rule_type: OverrideType,
    pub pattern: OverridePattern,
    pub target_field: String,
    pub priority: i32,
    pub conditions: Vec<OverrideCondition>,
    pub created_by: String,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub active: bool,
}

pub enum OverrideType {
    ExactMatch,
    RegexPattern,
    FuzzyMatch,
    PositionalMatch,
    ConditionalMatch,
}

pub struct OverridePattern {
    pub pattern: String,
    pub case_sensitive: bool,
    pub whole_word: bool,
    pub regex_flags: Option<String>,
}

pub struct OverrideEngine {
    overrides: Vec<MappingOverride>,
    override_cache: LruCache<String, Option<String>>,
    conflict_resolver: ConflictResolver,
    validator: OverrideValidator,
}
```

### Override Resolution Process
1. **Rule Matching**
   - Apply overrides in priority order
   - Check conditions and constraints
   - Cache results for performance

2. **Conflict Detection**
   - Identify conflicting override rules
   - Report ambiguous mappings
   - Suggest resolution strategies

3. **Fallback Handling**
   - Fall back to automatic mapping if no override matches
   - Log override application results
   - Track override effectiveness

### Key Features
- **Rule Validation**: Ensure override rules are syntactically correct
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rule matching and caching
- **User Interface**: Web-based override management interface
- **Import/Export**: Support for bulk override management

## Dependencies

- `regex` for pattern matching
- `serde` for serialization/deserialization
- `uuid` for unique override identifiers
- Database integration for persistence

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for override rule matching
- Integration tests with real mapping scenarios
- Performance tests for large override rule sets
- User interface testing for override management
- Conflict resolution testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Support multiple override rule types
- [x] Implement priority-based conflict resolution
- [x] Provide override rule validation
- [x] Enable import/export of override configurations
- [x] Maintain audit trail for override changes
- [x] Achieve <10ms override resolution time
- [x] Support 1000+ override rules efficiently
- [x] Pass comprehensive override functionality tests

## Related Tasks

- **Previous:** Build mapping confidence scoring
- **Next:** Create mapping validation reports
- **Depends on:** Column validation implementation
- **Enables:** Organization-specific customization

## Notes

- Design for ease of use by non-technical users
- Consider integration with existing configuration management
- Implement comprehensive validation to prevent invalid overrides
- Support for override rule templates and sharing
- Plan for future machine learning-assisted override suggestions
