}
```

### Report Sections
1. **Executive Summary**
   - High-level quality assessment
   - Key findings and recommendations
   - Risk assessment and compliance status

2. **Mapping Analysis**
   - Field-by-field mapping results
   - Confidence score analysis
   - Validation results and issues

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Data completeness analysis
   - Accuracy and consistency metrics
   - Trend analysis and comparisons

4. **Recommendations**
   - Prioritized improvement suggestions
   - Best practices and guidelines
   - Next steps and action items

### Key Features
- **Interactive Reports**: Clickable elements and drill-down capabilities
- **Customizable Templates**: Configurable report layouts and content
- **Automated Insights**: AI-powered analysis and recommendations
- **Export Options**: Multiple formats for different use cases

## Dependencies

- `plotters` or `charts` for data visualization
- `pdf-writer` for PDF report generation
- `tera` or `handlebars` for HTML templating
- `csv` for CSV export functionality

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for report generation logic
- Integration tests with real mapping data
- Performance tests for large dataset reports
- Visual regression tests for report layouts
- User acceptance testing for report usability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Generate comprehensive mapping quality reports
- [x] Support multiple report formats (PDF, HTML, JSON, CSV)
- [x] Provide actionable insights and recommendations
- [x] Include data visualization and trend analysis
- [x] Enable automated and on-demand report generation
