# Validate Severity Levels and Status Values

**Task ID:** 4tyEttWGoYt6tRFxmohKVx
**Component:** 1.3: POA&M Document Processor
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** High

## Overview

Validate POA&M severity levels and status values against allowed enumeration values to ensure compliance with FedRAMP requirements and OSCAL schema constraints.

## Objectives

- Validate severity levels against FedRAMP standards
- Check status values for compliance and consistency
- Implement business rule validation for POA&M workflows
- Provide detailed validation error reporting
- Support custom validation rules and overrides

## Technical Requirements

### Validation Categories
1. **Severity Level Validation**
   - Critical, High, Moderate, Low, Informational
   - CVSS score alignment with severity
   - Risk rating consistency checks
   - Impact and likelihood correlation

2. **Status Value Validation**
   - Open, In Progress, Completed, Accepted, Rejected, Deferred
   - Status transition validation
   - Date consistency with status changes
   - Required fields per status type

3. **Business Rule Validation**
   - Completion date requirements for closed items
   - Milestone consistency with status
   - Resource allocation validation
   - Approval workflow compliance

4. **Cross-Field Validation**
   - Risk assessment consistency
   - Date sequence validation
   - Reference integrity checks
   - Compliance requirement validation

### Core Functionality
1. **Enumeration Validation**
   - Validate against allowed value lists
   - Support case-insensitive matching
   - Handle common variations and aliases
   - Provide suggestion for invalid values

2. **Business Logic Validation**
   - Implement POA&M workflow rules
   - Validate status transitions
   - Check required field dependencies
   - Ensure data consistency

3. **Validation Reporting**
   - Detailed error messages with context
   - Severity classification of validation issues
   - Actionable recommendations for fixes
   - Validation summary and statistics

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct PoamValidator {
    severity_validator: SeverityValidator,
    status_validator: StatusValidator,
    business_rule_validator: BusinessRuleValidator,
    cross_field_validator: CrossFieldValidator,
    validation_config: PoamValidationConfig,
}

pub struct PoamValidationConfig {
    pub allowed_severities: Vec<PoamSeverity>,
    pub allowed_statuses: Vec<PoamStatus>,
    pub business_rules: Vec<BusinessRule>,
    pub validation_mode: ValidationMode,
    pub custom_rules: Vec<CustomValidationRule>,
}

pub struct ValidationResult {
    pub is_valid: bool,
    pub errors: Vec<ValidationError>,
    pub warnings: Vec<ValidationWarning>,
    pub suggestions: Vec<ValidationSuggestion>,
    pub field_results: HashMap<String, FieldValidationResult>,
}

pub enum ValidationSeverity {
    Error,      // Blocks processing
    Warning,    // Allows processing with notification
    Info,       // Informational only
}

pub struct BusinessRule {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub condition: RuleCondition,
    pub action: RuleAction,
    pub severity: ValidationSeverity,
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. **Severity Validation Rules**
   - Must be one of: Critical, High, Moderate, Low, Informational
   - CVSS score must align with severity level
   - Risk rating must be consistent with severity
   - Impact and likelihood must support severity assessment

2. **Status Validation Rules**
   - Must be one of: Open, In Progress, Completed, Accepted, Rejected, Deferred
   - Status transitions must follow allowed workflows
   - Completion date required for Completed status
   - Approval required for Accepted status

3. **Business Logic Rules**
   - Open items must have scheduled completion date
   - Completed items must have actual completion date
   - Deferred items must have justification
   - Critical items must have expedited timeline

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Cover all POA&M validation requirements
- **Configurable Rules**: Support custom validation rules per organization
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provide actionable validation feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient validation for large POA&M files

## Dependencies

- POA&M data model and enumerations
- Validation framework from core library
- Business rule engine
- Error reporting system

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each validation rule type
- Integration tests with real POA&M data
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Business rule validation accuracy tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Validate all severity levels against FedRAMP standards
- [x] Check status values for compliance and consistency
- [x] Implement comprehensive business rule validation
- [x] Provide detailed validation error reporting
- [x] Support configurable validation rules
- [x] Handle common value variations and aliases
- [x] Achieve <100ms validation time per POA&M item
- [x] Pass all POA&M validation test scenarios

## Related Tasks

- **Previous:** Map columns using poam_mappings.json configuration
- **Next:** Convert dates to ISO format
- **Depends on:** POA&M column mapping implementation
- **Enables:** Quality assurance and OSCAL compliance

## Notes

- Focus on FedRAMP-specific validation requirements
- Implement comprehensive error messaging for user guidance
- Support for validation rule customization per organization
- Consider integration with external validation services
- Plan for validation rule versioning and updates
