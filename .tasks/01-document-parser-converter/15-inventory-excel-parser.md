# Implement Inventory-Specific Excel Parser

**Task ID:** kjsMiXPcAXJ6M1MUwBqo5R  
**Component:** 1.4: Inventory Document Processor  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Create specialized parser for FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook with asset-specific handling, supporting complex inventory structures and asset categorization requirements.

## Objectives

- Implement inventory-specific Excel parsing logic
- Handle FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook structure
- Process asset-specific data types and relationships
- Support multiple inventory template variations
- Enable asset categorization and classification

## Technical Requirements

### Inventory Template Support
1. **FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook**
   - Standard FedRAMP inventory Excel template
   - Multi-worksheet structure (Hardware, Software, Network, etc.)
   - Asset categorization and classification
   - Relationship mapping between assets

2. **Asset Type Processing**
   - Hardware assets (servers, workstations, network devices)
   - Software assets (applications, operating systems, databases)
   - Network assets (routers, switches, firewalls)
   - Virtual assets (VMs, containers, cloud services)
   - Data assets (databases, file systems, repositories)

3. **Worksheet Structure**
   - Asset inventory worksheet (primary data)
   - Network topology worksheet
   - Software inventory worksheet
   - Vulnerability assessment worksheet
   - Asset relationships worksheet

### Core Functionality
1. **Asset-Specific Parsing**
   - Asset identification and categorization
   - Network configuration processing
   - Software version and licensing tracking
   - Vulnerability and patch status

2. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Asset dependencies and relationships
   - Network topology and connectivity
   - Software-hardware associations
   - Data flow and access patterns

3. **Data Enrichment**
   - Asset classification and categorization
   - Risk assessment and scoring
   - Compliance status determination
   - Automated field population

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct InventoryParser {
    base_parser: ExcelParser,
    template_detector: InventoryTemplateDetector,
    asset_processor: AssetProcessor,
    relationship_mapper: RelationshipMapper,
    validator: InventoryValidator,
}

pub struct Asset {
    pub asset_id: String,
    pub asset_name: String,
    pub asset_type: AssetType,
    pub asset_category: AssetCategory,
    pub description: String,
    pub owner: String,
    pub location: Option<String>,

}

pub enum AssetType {
    Hardware,
    Software,
    Network,
    Virtual,
    Data,
    Service,
    Cloud,
}

pub enum Environment {
    Production,
    Development,
    Testing,
    Staging,
    Training,
    Disaster_Recovery,
}

pub struct NetworkInfo {
    pub ip_addresses: Vec<IpAddr>,
    pub mac_addresses: Vec<String>,
    pub network_segments: Vec<String>,
    pub ports: Vec<NetworkPort>,
    pub protocols: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Inventory-Specific Processing
1. **Asset Classification**
   - Automatic asset type detection
   - Category assignment based on characteristics
   - Criticality assessment and scoring
   - Environment classification

2. **Network Processing**
   - IP address validation and normalization
   - MAC address format standardization
   - Network topology mapping
   - Port and protocol analysis

3. **Software Inventory**
   - Software identification and versioning
   - License tracking and compliance
   - Vulnerability assessment integration
   - Patch status monitoring

### Key Features
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Handle diverse asset types and categories
- **Relationship Mapping**: Complex asset relationship processing
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive inventory data validation
- **Template Flexibility**: Support various inventory template formats

## Dependencies

- Base Excel Parser Engine
- Column Mapping Engine
- Network processing libraries (`ipnet`, `mac_address`)
- Asset classification frameworks

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for inventory-specific parsing logic
- Integration tests with real inventory templates
- Asset type classification accuracy tests
- Network data processing validation tests
- Performance tests with large inventory files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parse FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook successfully
