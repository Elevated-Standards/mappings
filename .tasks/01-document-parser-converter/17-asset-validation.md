# Validate Asset Types and Environments

**Task ID:** 79FJH2QNqzRCZmv7cgVaiF  
**Component:** 1.4: Inventory Document Processor  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Validate asset types and environment values against allowed enumeration values to ensure inventory data consistency and compliance with FedRAMP requirements.

## Objectives

- Validate asset types against standard classifications
- Check environment values for compliance
- Implement asset-specific validation rules
- Ensure data consistency across inventory
- Provide detailed validation reporting

## Technical Requirements

### Validation Categories
1. **Asset Type Validation**
   - Hardware, Software, Network, Virtual, Data, Service, Cloud
   - Asset subtype and category validation
   - Vendor-specific asset classifications
   - Custom asset type support

2. **Environment Validation**
   - Production, Development, Testing, Staging, Training, DR
   - Environment-specific requirements
   - Security boundary validation
   - Compliance zone verification

3. **Asset Attribute Validation**
   - Criticality levels and impact ratings
   - Ownership and responsibility validation
   - Location and facility verification
   - Network and connectivity validation

4. **Cross-Asset Validation**
   - Asset relationship consistency
   - Dependency validation
   - Network topology verification
   - Service mapping accuracy

### Core Functionality
1. **Enumeration Validation**
   - Validate against predefined value lists
   - Support case-insensitive matching
   - Handle common variations and aliases
   - Provide suggestions for invalid values

2. **Business Rule Validation**
   - Asset type-specific requirements
   - Environment-based constraints
   - Compliance framework requirements
   - Organizational policy validation

3. **Data Consistency Checks**
   - Cross-field validation
   - Relationship integrity checks
   - Network configuration validation
   - Software-hardware compatibility

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct AssetValidator {
    type_validator: AssetTypeValidator,
    environment_validator: EnvironmentValidator,
    attribute_validator: AttributeValidator,
    relationship_validator: RelationshipValidator,
    validation_config: AssetValidationConfig,
}

pub struct AssetValidationConfig {
    pub allowed_asset_types: Vec<AssetType>,
    pub allowed_environments: Vec<Environment>,
    pub criticality_levels: Vec<CriticalityLevel>,
    pub validation_rules: Vec<AssetValidationRule>,
    pub custom_enumerations: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}

pub struct AssetValidationResult {
    pub is_valid: bool,
    pub asset_id: String,
    pub errors: Vec<ValidationError>,
    pub warnings: Vec<ValidationWarning>,
    pub suggestions: Vec<ValidationSuggestion>,
    pub compliance_status: ComplianceStatus,
}

pub struct AssetValidationRule {
    pub name: String,
    pub asset_types: Vec<AssetType>,
    pub environments: Vec<Environment>,
    pub condition: RuleCondition,
    pub validation: RuleValidation,
    pub severity: ValidationSeverity,
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. **Asset Type Rules**
   - Must be valid asset type enumeration
   - Subtype must be compatible with main type
   - Asset characteristics must match type
   - Vendor information must be consistent

2. **Environment Rules**
   - Must be valid environment enumeration
   - Environment must match security requirements
   - Compliance zone must be appropriate
   - Access controls must align with environment

3. **Attribute Rules**
   - Criticality must be valid level
   - Owner must be valid entity
   - Location must be valid facility
   - Network configuration must be valid

4. **Relationship Rules**
   - Dependencies must be valid assets
   - Network connections must be logical
   - Software-hardware relationships must be valid
   - Service mappings must be accurate

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Cover all asset validation requirements
- **Configurable Rules**: Support custom validation per organization
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provide actionable validation feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient validation for large inventories

## Dependencies

- Asset data model and enumerations
- Validation framework from core library
- Business rule engine
- Network validation libraries

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each validation rule type
- Integration tests with real inventory data
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Validation accuracy and completeness tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Validate all asset types against standard classifications
- [ ] Check environment values for compliance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive asset validation rules
- [ ] Provide detailed validation error reporting
- [ ] Support configurable validation rules
- [ ] Handle asset type and environment variations
- [ ] Achieve <50ms validation time per asset
- [ ] Pass all asset validation test scenarios

## Related Tasks

- **Previous:** Map columns using inventory_mappings.json
- **Next:** Process IP addresses and network data
- **Depends on:** Inventory column mapping implementation
- **Enables:** Quality assurance and compliance validation

## Notes

- Focus on FedRAMP-specific asset requirements
- Support for custom asset types and environments
- Implement comprehensive error messaging
- Consider integration with asset management standards
- Plan for validation rule evolution and updates
