# Implement Asset Relationship Mapping

**Task ID:** jtqQzNaDqTHusjf1wNQ6ow  
**Component:** 1.4: Inventory Document Processor  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  

## Overview

Map relationships between assets and components in the inventory to create comprehensive dependency models and support complex system architecture representation.

## Objectives

- Identify and map asset relationships and dependencies
- Create comprehensive dependency models
- Support complex system architecture representation
- Enable impact analysis and risk assessment
- Maintain relationship integrity and consistency

## Technical Requirements

### Relationship Types
1. **Physical Relationships**
   - Hardware-to-hardware connections
   - Network device connectivity
   - Power and infrastructure dependencies
   - Physical location relationships

2. **Logical Relationships**
   - Software-to-hardware installations
   - Application dependencies
   - Data flow relationships
   - Service dependencies

3. **Network Relationships**
   - Network connectivity and topology
   - Protocol and port relationships
   - Security boundary relationships
   - Traffic flow patterns

4. **Operational Relationships**
   - Ownership and responsibility
   - Support and maintenance relationships
   - Backup and recovery dependencies
   - Compliance and audit relationships

### Core Functionality
1. **Relationship Discovery**
   - Automatic relationship detection
   - Pattern-based relationship identification
   - Cross-reference analysis
   - Dependency inference

2. **Relationship Validation**
   - Consistency checking across relationships
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Relationship integrity validation
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Relationship Modeling**
   - Hierarchical relationship structures
   - Multi-dimensional relationship mapping
   - Temporal relationship tracking
   - Relationship strength and confidence

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct RelationshipMapper {
    relationship_detector: RelationshipDetector,
    dependency_analyzer: DependencyAnalyzer,
    validation_engine: RelationshipValidator,
    graph_builder: RelationshipGraphBuilder,
}

pub struct AssetRelationship {
    pub relationship_id: Uuid,
    pub source_asset: String,
    pub target_asset: String,
    pub relationship_type: RelationshipType,
    pub relationship_strength: f64,
    pub bidirectional: bool,
    pub properties: HashMap<String, Value>,
    pub metadata: RelationshipMetadata,
}

pub enum RelationshipType {
    DependsOn,
    ConnectedTo,
    InstalledOn,
    HostedBy,
    Manages,
    Monitors,
    BacksUp,
    Replicates,

    Inherits,
    Implements,
    Custom(String),
}

pub struct RelationshipGraph {
    pub nodes: HashMap<String, AssetNode>,
    pub edges: Vec<RelationshipEdge>,
    pub clusters: Vec<AssetCluster>,
    pub critical_paths: Vec<CriticalPath>,
}

pub struct DependencyAnalysis {
    pub dependency_chains: Vec<DependencyChain>,
    pub circular_dependencies: Vec<CircularDependency>,
    pub critical_assets: Vec<CriticalAsset>,
    pub impact_analysis: ImpactAnalysis,
}
```

### Relationship Detection Methods
1. **Pattern-Based Detection**
   - Network connectivity patterns
   - Software installation patterns
   - Naming convention analysis
   - Configuration file analysis

2. **Cross-Reference Analysis**
   - Asset ID cross-references
   - IP address relationships
   - Service port mappings
   - Configuration dependencies

3. **Inference Rules**
   - Business logic-based inference
   - Industry standard relationships
   - Common architecture patterns
   - Organizational conventions

### Key Features
- **Automatic Discovery**: Intelligent relationship detection
- **Multi-Type Support**: Handle diverse relationship types
- **Graph Analysis**: Comprehensive dependency analysis
