# Implement Async Document Processing Queue

**Task ID:** ny13d6uPE8gwKvKnqnW9SM  
**Component:** 1.7: Batch Processing Engine  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Create async queue system using Tokio for processing multiple documents concurrently, enabling efficient batch processing of large document sets with proper resource management and error handling.

## Objectives

- Implement async document processing queue using Tokio
- Support concurrent processing of multiple documents
- Enable efficient resource utilization and management
- Provide queue management and monitoring capabilities
- Support priority-based processing and scheduling

## Technical Requirements

### Queue Architecture
1. **Async Processing Queue**
   - Tokio-based async runtime
   - Concurrent document processing
   - Configurable concurrency limits
   - Memory and resource management

2. **Job Management**
   - Job queuing and scheduling
   - Priority-based processing
   - Job status tracking and monitoring
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Resource Management**
   - Memory usage monitoring and limits
   - CPU utilization management
   - I/O throttling and optimization
   - Garbage collection and cleanup

### Core Functionality
1. **Queue Operations**
   - Job submission and queuing
   - Concurrent job execution
   - Job cancellation and timeout
   - Queue monitoring and statistics

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Document parsing and validation
   - Content extraction and transformation
   - OSCAL generation and validation
   - Output formatting and storage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery
   - Retry logic with backoff
   - Dead letter queue for failed jobs
   - Error reporting and notification

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct AsyncProcessingQueue {
    job_queue: Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<ProcessingJob>>>,
    worker_pool: WorkerPool,
    job_manager: JobManager,
    resource_monitor: ResourceMonitor,
    config: QueueConfig,
}

pub struct ProcessingJob {
    pub job_id: Uuid,
    pub document_path: PathBuf,
    pub document_type: DocumentType,
    pub priority: JobPriority,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub started_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub completed_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub status: JobStatus,
    pub retry_count: u32,
    pub error_info: Option<ErrorInfo>,
}

pub struct WorkerPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    semaphore: Arc<Semaphore>,
    shutdown_signal: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    metrics: Arc<Mutex<WorkerMetrics>>,
}

pub struct QueueConfig {
    pub max_concurrent_jobs: usize,
    pub max_queue_size: usize,
    pub job_timeout: Duration,
    pub retry_attempts: u32,
    pub retry_backoff: Duration,
    pub memory_limit: usize,
}

pub enum JobStatus {
    Queued,
    Processing,
    Completed,
    Failed,
    Cancelled,
    Retrying,
}

pub enum JobPriority {
    Low,
    Normal,
    High,
    Critical,
}
```

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Job Submission**
   - Validate job parameters
   - Assign priority and scheduling
   - Add to processing queue
   - Return job tracking information

2. **Concurrent Execution**
   - Worker pool management
   - Resource allocation and monitoring
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Result Management**
   - Output collection and storage
   - Status updates and notifications
   - Metrics collection and reporting
   - Cleanup and resource release

### Key Features
- **High Concurrency**: Efficient concurrent document processing
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive resource monitoring and limits
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Real-time queue and job monitoring

## Dependencies

- `tokio` for async runtime and concurrency
- `tokio-util` for additional async utilities
- `futures` for stream and async processing
- `dashmap` for concurrent data structures
