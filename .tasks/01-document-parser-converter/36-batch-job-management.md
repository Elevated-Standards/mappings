# Create Batch Job Management

**Task ID:** 3GPPHPJLtkyNgvEUfpKJ8n  
**Component:** 1.7: Batch Processing Engine  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Build job management system for tracking and controlling batch processing operations, enabling comprehensive oversight and control of large-scale document processing workflows.

## Objectives

- Implement comprehensive batch job management system
- Support job lifecycle tracking and control
- Enable job scheduling and dependency management
- Provide job monitoring and reporting capabilities
- Support job cancellation and recovery operations

## Technical Requirements

### Job Management Features
1. **Job Lifecycle Management**
   - Job creation and submission
   - Job scheduling and execution
   - Job monitoring and status tracking
   - Job completion and cleanup

2. **Job Control Operations**
   - Job cancellation and termination
   - Job pause and resume functionality
   - Job priority adjustment
   - Job dependency management

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Batch job creation and submission
   - Batch status monitoring
   - Batch completion reporting
   - Batch error handling and recovery

### Core Functionality
1. **Job Tracking**
   - Real-time job status monitoring
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error and exception tracking

2. **Job Scheduling**
   - Priority-based job scheduling
   - Dependency-aware execution
   - Resource-based scheduling
   - Time-based job scheduling

3. **Job Control**
   - Interactive job management
   - Bulk job operations
   - Job recovery and restart
   - Emergency job termination

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct BatchJobManager {
    job_store: Arc<RwLock<JobStore>>,
    scheduler: JobScheduler,
    monitor: JobMonitor,
    controller: JobController,
    config: JobManagerConfig,
}

pub struct JobStore {
    active_jobs: HashMap<Uuid, JobInfo>,
    completed_jobs: LruCache<Uuid, JobInfo>,
    failed_jobs: HashMap<Uuid, JobInfo>,
    job_dependencies: HashMap<Uuid, Vec<Uuid>>,
    job_metrics: HashMap<Uuid, JobMetrics>,
}

pub struct JobInfo {
    pub job_id: Uuid,
    pub batch_id: Option<Uuid>,
    pub job_type: JobType,
    pub status: JobStatus,
    pub priority: JobPriority,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub started_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub completed_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub progress: JobProgress,
    pub dependencies: Vec<Uuid>,
    pub metadata: JobMetadata,
}

pub struct JobProgress {
    pub current_step: String,
    pub steps_completed: usize,
    pub total_steps: usize,
    pub percentage: f64,
    pub estimated_completion: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}

pub struct BatchInfo {
    pub batch_id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub job_ids: Vec<Uuid>,
    pub status: BatchStatus,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub started_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub completed_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub progress: BatchProgress,
}

pub enum BatchStatus {
    Created,
    Queued,
    Running,
    Paused,
    Completed,
    Failed,
    Cancelled,
}
```

### Job Management Operations
1. **Job Creation and Submission**
   - Validate job parameters and dependencies
   - Assign job IDs and metadata
   - Queue jobs for execution
   - Return job tracking information

2. **Job Monitoring and Control**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Interactive job control operations

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Batch creation and management
   - Batch-level monitoring and control
   - Batch completion and reporting
   - Batch error handling and recovery

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Complete job lifecycle monitoring
- **Interactive Control**: Real-time job management and control
- **Dependency Management**: Job dependency tracking and execution
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient batch-level operations and monitoring

## Dependencies

- Job storage and persistence systems
- Scheduling and execution frameworks
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Notification and alerting systems

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for job management operations
- Integration tests with processing queue
- Job lifecycle and dependency testing
- Batch operation validation
- Performance and scalability testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement comprehensive job lifecycle management
- [ ] Support job scheduling and dependency management
- [ ] Enable real-time job monitoring and control
- [ ] Provide batch operation capabilities
- [ ] Support job cancellation and recovery
- [ ] Enable job priority and resource management
- [ ] Achieve <100ms job status update time
- [ ] Pass comprehensive job management tests
