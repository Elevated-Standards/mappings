# Add Support for Processing Priorities

**Task ID:** cNrCRTvJ18edFX5HRfgyrJ  
**Component:** 1.7: Batch Processing Engine  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Low  

## Overview

Implement priority-based processing to handle urgent documents first, enabling efficient resource allocation and ensuring critical documents receive expedited processing.

## Objectives

- Implement priority-based job scheduling and execution
- Support dynamic priority adjustment and escalation
- Enable resource allocation based on priority levels
- Provide priority-aware queue management
- Support SLA-based priority assignment

## Technical Requirements

### Priority System
1. **Priority Levels**
   - Critical (emergency processing)
   - High (urgent business requirements)
   - Normal (standard processing)
   - Low (background processing)
   - Deferred (process when resources available)

2. **Priority Assignment**
   - Manual priority assignment
   - Automatic priority based on document type
   - SLA-based priority calculation
   - Dynamic priority adjustment

3. **Priority Enforcement**
   - Priority-aware job scheduling
   - Resource allocation by priority
   - Queue management and ordering
   - Preemption and interruption support

### Core Functionality
1. **Priority Queue Management**
   - Multi-level priority queues
   - Priority-based job ordering
   - Dynamic queue rebalancing
   - Priority escalation mechanisms

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Priority-based resource assignment
   - Resource reservation for high-priority jobs
   - Dynamic resource reallocation
   - Resource contention resolution

3. **SLA Management**
   - SLA definition and tracking
   - SLA-based priority calculation
   - SLA violation detection and escalation
   - SLA reporting and compliance

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct PriorityManager {
    priority_queues: HashMap<Priority, VecDeque<ProcessingJob>>,
    priority_calculator: PriorityCalculator,
    sla_manager: SlaManager,
    resource_allocator: PriorityResourceAllocator,
    escalation_engine: EscalationEngine,
}

pub struct PriorityCalculator {
    priority_rules: Vec<PriorityRule>,
    sla_mappings: HashMap<DocumentType, SlaRequirement>,
    escalation_policies: Vec<EscalationPolicy>,
    dynamic_adjustments: HashMap<Uuid, PriorityAdjustment>,
}

pub struct SlaRequirement {
    pub document_type: DocumentType,
    pub max_processing_time: Duration,
    pub priority_escalation_threshold: Duration,
    pub business_criticality: BusinessCriticality,
    pub compliance_requirements: Vec<ComplianceRequirement>,
}

pub struct PriorityRule {
    pub name: String,
    pub condition: RuleCondition,
    pub priority_assignment: Priority,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub active: bool,
}

pub struct EscalationPolicy {
    pub trigger_condition: EscalationTrigger,
    pub escalation_action: EscalationAction,
    pub notification_targets: Vec<NotificationTarget>,
    pub escalation_delay: Duration,
}

pub enum Priority {
    Critical = 0,
    High = 1,
    Normal = 2,
    Low = 3,
    Deferred = 4,
}

pub enum BusinessCriticality {
    MissionCritical,
    BusinessCritical,
    Important,
    Standard,
    LowImpact,
}
```

### Priority Processing Logic
1. **Priority Assignment**
   - Evaluate priority rules and conditions
   - Calculate SLA-based priorities
   - Apply manual priority overrides
   - Document priority decisions

2. **Queue Management**
   - Maintain separate queues per priority level
   - Implement priority-aware job selection
   - Handle priority changes and requeuing
   - Monitor queue depths and balance

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Allocate resources based on priority
   - Reserve resources for critical jobs
   - Implement preemption for urgent jobs
   - Balance resource utilization

### Key Features
- **Multi-Level Priorities**: Comprehensive priority level support
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Real-time priority modification capabilities
- **SLA Integration**: SLA-based priority calculation and enforcement
- **Resource Optimization**: Priority-aware resource allocation

## Dependencies

- Job scheduling and queue management systems
- SLA definition and tracking frameworks
- Resource monitoring and allocation tools
- Notification and escalation systems

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for priority calculation and assignment
- Integration tests with job scheduling system
- SLA compliance and escalation testing
- Resource allocation fairness validation
- Priority queue performance testing
