# Implement Validation Rules from Mapping Files

**Task ID:** 1iu8zdPWs1FsqmWNUpBDPK  
**Component:** 1.8: Validation & Quality Assurance  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Load and implement validation rules defined in the existing mapping configuration files to ensure comprehensive data validation and quality assurance across all document types.

## Objectives

- Load validation rules from existing mapping configuration files
- Implement comprehensive validation rule engine
- Support rule-based validation across all document types
- Enable custom validation rule definition and management
- Provide detailed validation reporting and feedback

## Technical Requirements

### Validation Rule System
1. **Rule Loading and Management**
   - Load rules from mapping configuration files
   - Parse and validate rule definitions
   - Support rule versioning and updates
   - Enable rule activation and deactivation

2. **Rule Types and Categories**
   - Field validation rules (format, range, enumeration)
   - Cross-field validation rules (consistency, dependencies)
   - Business logic validation rules (workflow, compliance)
   - Schema validation rules (structure, required fields)

3. **Rule Execution Engine**
   - Efficient rule evaluation and execution
   - Rule dependency management
   - Parallel rule execution where possible
   - Rule result aggregation and reporting

### Core Functionality
1. **Rule Definition Framework**
   - Declarative rule definition language
   - Rule condition and action specification
   - Rule metadata and documentation
   - Rule testing and validation

2. **Validation Execution**
   - Document-level validation orchestration
   - Field-level validation execution
   - Rule result collection and analysis
   - Error and warning generation

3. **Rule Management**
   - Rule lifecycle management
   - Rule performance monitoring
   - Rule effectiveness analysis
   - Rule optimization and tuning

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct ValidationRuleEngine {
    rule_loader: RuleLoader,
    rule_executor: RuleExecutor,
    rule_manager: RuleManager,
    result_aggregator: ResultAggregator,
}

pub struct ValidationRule {
    pub rule_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub rule_type: RuleType,
    pub severity: ValidationSeverity,
    pub condition: RuleCondition,
    pub action: RuleAction,
    pub metadata: RuleMetadata,
    pub active: bool,
}

pub enum RuleType {
    FieldValidation,
    CrossFieldValidation,
    BusinessLogic,
    SchemaValidation,
    ComplianceCheck,
    QualityAssurance,
}

pub struct RuleCondition {
    pub expression: String,
    pub parameters: HashMap<String, Value>,
    pub dependencies: Vec<String>,
    pub context_requirements: Vec<ContextRequirement>,
}

pub struct RuleAction {
    pub action_type: ActionType,
    pub message_template: String,
    pub suggested_fix: Option<String>,
    pub escalation_rules: Vec<EscalationRule>,
}

pub enum ActionType {
    Error,
    Warning,
    Information,
    AutoFix,
    Escalate,
}

pub struct ValidationRuleResult {
    pub rule_id: String,
    pub passed: bool,
    pub severity: ValidationSeverity,
    pub message: String,
    pub affected_fields: Vec<String>,
    pub suggested_fix: Option<String>,
    pub execution_time: Duration,
}
```

### Rule Implementation Process
1. **Rule Loading**
   - Parse mapping configuration files
   - Extract validation rule definitions
   - Validate rule syntax and dependencies
   - Register rules in rule engine

2. **Rule Execution**
   - Evaluate rule conditions against data
   - Execute rule actions for violations
   - Collect and aggregate results
   - Generate validation reports

3. **Rule Management**
   - Monitor rule performance and effectiveness
   - Update and maintain rule definitions
   - Handle rule conflicts and dependencies
   - Optimize rule execution order

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support for all validation rule types
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rule execution and evaluation
- **Flexible Configuration**: Declarative rule definition and management
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive validation result reporting

## Dependencies

- Existing mapping configuration files
- Rule expression evaluation libraries
- Validation framework components
- Performance monitoring tools

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for rule loading and execution
- Integration tests with mapping configuration files
