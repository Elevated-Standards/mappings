# Create Data Completeness Checks

**Task ID:** dz4a5JDXKGjujQUNMGpppE  
**Component:** 1.8: Validation & Quality Assurance  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Implement checks to ensure all required fields are present and properly populated, providing comprehensive assessment of data completeness across all document types and processing stages.

## Objectives

- Implement comprehensive data completeness validation
- Check required field presence and population
- Assess data quality and completeness scores
- Provide detailed completeness reporting
- Support completeness threshold configuration

## Technical Requirements

### Completeness Assessment
1. **Required Field Validation**
   - Mandatory field presence checking
   - Field population validation
   - Data format and structure validation
   - Conditional requirement validation

2. **Completeness Scoring**
   - Field-level completeness calculation
   - Document-level completeness scoring
   - Weighted completeness metrics
   - Completeness trend analysis

3. **Quality Thresholds**
   - Configurable completeness thresholds
   - Quality gate enforcement
   - Threshold-based alerting
   - Compliance requirement validation

### Core Functionality
1. **Completeness Analysis Engine**
   - Systematic field analysis
   - Missing data identification
   - Incomplete data detection
   - Quality score calculation

2. **Requirement Management**
   - Dynamic requirement definition
   - Context-aware requirements
   - Conditional requirement evaluation
   - Requirement dependency tracking

3. **Reporting and Alerting**
   - Detailed completeness reports
   - Missing data identification
   - Quality improvement recommendations
   - Threshold violation alerts

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct CompletenessChecker {
    requirement_manager: RequirementManager,
    completeness_analyzer: CompletenessAnalyzer,
    scoring_engine: ScoringEngine,
    threshold_manager: ThresholdManager,
}

pub struct RequirementManager {
    field_requirements: HashMap<DocumentType, Vec<FieldRequirement>>,
    conditional_requirements: Vec<ConditionalRequirement>,
    requirement_groups: HashMap<String, RequirementGroup>,
    requirement_dependencies: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}

pub struct FieldRequirement {
    pub field_name: String,
    pub required: bool,
    pub data_type: DataType,
    pub format_requirements: Vec<FormatRequirement>,
    pub validation_rules: Vec<ValidationRule>,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub context_conditions: Vec<ContextCondition>,
}

pub struct CompletenessResult {
    pub overall_score: f64,
    pub field_scores: HashMap<String, f64>,
    pub missing_required: Vec<String>,
    pub incomplete_fields: Vec<String>,
    pub quality_issues: Vec<QualityIssue>,
    pub recommendations: Vec<Recommendation>,
}

pub struct CompletenessMetrics {
    pub total_fields: usize,
    pub required_fields: usize,
    pub populated_fields: usize,
    pub missing_required: usize,
    pub incomplete_optional: usize,
    pub completeness_percentage: f64,
    pub quality_score: f64,
}

pub struct QualityThreshold {
    pub threshold_name: String,
    pub minimum_score: f64,
    pub required_fields_threshold: f64,
    pub overall_completeness_threshold: f64,
    pub enforcement_level: EnforcementLevel,
}

pub enum EnforcementLevel {
    Advisory,
    Warning,
    Error,
    Blocking,
}
```

### Completeness Assessment Process
1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Load field requirements for document type
   - Evaluate conditional requirements
   - Identify mandatory and optional fields
   - Calculate requirement weights

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Check field presence and population
   - Validate data format and structure
   - Assess data quality and completeness
   - Identify missing and incomplete data

3. **Scoring and Reporting**
   - Calculate completeness scores
   - Generate quality metrics
   - Create detailed reports
   - Provide improvement recommendations

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Complete data completeness evaluation
