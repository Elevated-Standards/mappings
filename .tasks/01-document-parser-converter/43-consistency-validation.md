# Add Consistency Validation Across Documents

**Task ID:** 95gXMmXe7Suhhh2FwNUMwe  
**Component:** 1.8: Validation & Quality Assurance  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  

## Overview

Validate data consistency across related documents and cross-references to ensure referential integrity and logical consistency in the FedRAMP compliance documentation ecosystem.

## Objectives

- Implement cross-document consistency validation
- Validate referential integrity across document types
- Check logical consistency of related data elements
- Support consistency rule definition and management
- Provide detailed consistency reporting and analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Consistency Validation Types
1. **Cross-Document References**
   - Asset references between inventory and POA&M
   - Control references between SSP and POA&M
   - System references across all document types
   - Contact and responsible party consistency

2. **Data Element Consistency**
   - Asset naming and identification consistency
   - Control implementation consistency
   - Risk assessment alignment
   - Timeline and date consistency

3. **Logical Consistency**
   - Business rule compliance across documents
   - Workflow state consistency
   - Dependency relationship validation
   - Compliance status alignment

### Core Functionality
1. **Cross-Reference Analysis**
   - Document relationship mapping
   - Reference validation and verification
   - Orphaned reference detection
   - Circular reference identification

2. **Consistency Rule Engine**
   - Rule-based consistency checking
   - Multi-document validation rules
   - Context-aware consistency evaluation
   - Rule conflict resolution

3. **Integrity Monitoring**
   - Real-time consistency monitoring
   - Change impact analysis
   - Consistency drift detection
   - Automated consistency repair

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct ConsistencyValidator {
    reference_analyzer: ReferenceAnalyzer,
    consistency_engine: ConsistencyEngine,
    integrity_monitor: IntegrityMonitor,
    rule_manager: ConsistencyRuleManager,
}

pub struct ReferenceAnalyzer {
    document_registry: DocumentRegistry,
    reference_map: HashMap<String, Vec<Reference>>,
    reverse_reference_map: HashMap<String, Vec<Reference>>,
    orphaned_references: Vec<OrphanedReference>,
}

pub struct ConsistencyRule {
    pub rule_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub source_documents: Vec<DocumentType>,
    pub target_documents: Vec<DocumentType>,
    pub consistency_check: ConsistencyCheck,
    pub severity: ValidationSeverity,
    pub auto_repair: bool,
}

pub struct ConsistencyCheck {
    pub check_type: ConsistencyCheckType,
    pub source_fields: Vec<String>,
    pub target_fields: Vec<String>,
    pub comparison_logic: ComparisonLogic,
    pub tolerance: Option<Tolerance>,
}

pub enum ConsistencyCheckType {
    ExactMatch,
    ValueRange,
    FormatConsistency,
    LogicalConsistency,
    TemporalConsistency,
    ReferentialIntegrity,
}

pub struct ConsistencyResult {
    pub is_consistent: bool,
    pub consistency_score: f64,
    pub violations: Vec<ConsistencyViolation>,
    pub warnings: Vec<ConsistencyWarning>,
    pub repair_suggestions: Vec<RepairSuggestion>,
}

pub struct ConsistencyViolation {
    pub violation_type: ViolationType,
    pub severity: ValidationSeverity,
    pub source_document: String,
    pub target_document: String,
    pub affected_fields: Vec<String>,
    pub description: String,
    pub suggested_resolution: Option<String>,
}
```

### Consistency Validation Process
1. **Document Analysis**
   - Analyze document relationships and dependencies
   - Map cross-references and data relationships
   - Identify consistency validation requirements
   - Build validation execution plan

2. **Consistency Checking**
   - Execute consistency rules across documents
   - Validate referential integrity
   - Check logical consistency constraints
   - Identify violations and inconsistencies

3. **Result Analysis and Reporting**
   - Analyze consistency violations
   - Generate repair suggestions
   - Create detailed consistency reports
   - Track consistency trends and improvements

### Key Features
- **Multi-Document Validation**: Comprehensive cross-document consistency checking
- **Referential Integrity**: Complete reference validation and verification
- **Automated Repair**: Intelligent consistency repair suggestions
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous consistency monitoring and alerting

## Dependencies

- Document relationship mapping systems
- Cross-reference analysis tools
- Consistency rule definition frameworks
- Repair and resolution engines

## Testing Requirements
