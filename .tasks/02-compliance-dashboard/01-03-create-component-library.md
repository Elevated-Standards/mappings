**Task ID:** viqQDvhgwNaKb3UkeXwuJX  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** Dashboard Architecture & Framework Setup

## Description
Build reusable UI components specifically for compliance data visualization including charts, status indicators, and control cards.

## Technical Requirements
- Reusable component architecture
- Consistent design system
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Theme support
- Component documentation
- TypeScript interfaces

## Components to Create
- [ ] StatusIndicator (Implemented/Not Implemented/Partial)
- [ ] ControlCard (displays individual control information)
- [ ] ComplianceChart (pie charts, bar charts for metrics)
- [ ] ProgressBar (baseline completion progress)
- [ ] AlertBadge (for notifications and warnings)
- [ ] FilterDropdown (for framework/status filtering)
- [ ] SearchBox (control search functionality)
- [ ] DataTable (sortable, filterable control lists)
- [ ] Modal (for control details)
- [ ] Tooltip (for additional information)

## Tasks
- [ ] Design component API and interfaces
- [ ] Implement base component structure
- [ ] Create status indicator components
- [ ] Build chart and visualization components
- [ ] Implement form and input components
- [ ] Create navigation and layout components
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Implement theming system
- [ ] Write component documentation
- [ ] Create component storybook

## Dependencies
- Frontend framework setup
- Design system guidelines
- Accessibility requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components are reusable and well-documented
- [ ] Components follow consistent design patterns
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met
- [ ] Components support theming
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces are properly defined
- [ ] Component library is documented
- [ ] Components are tested

## Definition of Done
- Component library is complete and functional
- All components pass accessibility tests
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Components are properly typed
- Unit tests cover all components
- Storybook or similar documentation tool is set up

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/` directory structure
- `src/types/` component interfaces
- `src/styles/` component styles
- Component documentation files
- Storybook configuration

## Design Considerations
- Consistent color scheme for compliance status
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design for all components
- Loading states for data-driven components
- Error states and fallbacks

## Notes
This component library will be the foundation for all dashboard UI elements. Focus on reusability and consistency.
