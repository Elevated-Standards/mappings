# Framework Baseline Tracking

**Task ID:** m9YUj5EKy691TBtq8fL7FM  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days  
**Status:** Not Started  

## Description
Implement tracking and visualization of progress against various compliance baselines including FedRAMP and NIST baselines.

## Technical Requirements
- Track progress against FedRAMP baselines (Low/Moderate/High)
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 baseline compliance
- NIST 800-171 R3 domain tracking
- Custom baseline support

## Subtasks
1. Load baseline definitions from control_mappings.json
2. Create baseline progress indicators
3. Implement baseline comparison views
4. Add baseline gap identification
5. Create baseline compliance reports
6. Support custom baseline creation

## Dependencies
- Configuration Management (1.5)
- Control Mapping Engine
- Data Models

## Baseline Types
- **FedRAMP Low:** Basic cloud security controls
- **FedRAMP Moderate:** Enhanced security for moderate impact systems
- **FedRAMP High:** Comprehensive controls for high impact systems
- **NIST 800-53 Rev 5:** Full framework implementation
- **NIST 800-171 R3:** CUI protection requirements
- **Custom:** Organization-specific baselines

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All standard baselines are supported
- [ ] Progress tracking is accurate and real-time
- [ ] Gap identification highlights missing controls
- [ ] Custom baselines can be created and managed
- [ ] Baseline comparisons show clear differences
- [ ] Reports provide actionable insights

## Definition of Done
- All subtasks completed and tested
- Baseline data loads correctly from configuration
- Progress indicators are accurate
- Gap analysis provides meaningful results
- Custom baseline functionality works
- Performance meets requirements

## Notes
This feature enables organizations to track their compliance progress against industry-standard baselines and create custom requirements.
