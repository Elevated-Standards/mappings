**Task ID:** cqb7WkqM5xNmNJ9ndRdf3P  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 days  
**Status:** Not Started  

## Description
Develop capabilities to display and compare multiple compliance frameworks simultaneously with unified scoring.

## Technical Requirements
- Simultaneous display of multiple frameworks
- Cross-framework control mapping
- Unified compliance scoring
- Framework comparison tools

## Subtasks
1. Create multi-framework layout
2. Implement framework switching/overlay
3. Build cross-framework mapping visualization
4. Add unified compliance scoring
5. Create framework comparison matrix
6. Implement framework-specific customizations

## Dependencies
- Control Mapping Engine
- Framework definitions
- Dashboard Architecture

## Framework Support
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5
- NIST 800-171 R3
- FedRAMP (Low/Moderate/High)
- ISO 27001
- SOC 2
- Custom frameworks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple frameworks display simultaneously
- [ ] Cross-framework mappings are accurate
- [ ] Unified scoring provides meaningful comparison
- [ ] Framework switching is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Comparison matrix highlights gaps and overlaps
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with multiple frameworks

## Definition of Done
- Multi-framework display is functional
- Cross-framework mappings work correctly
- Unified scoring algorithm is implemented
- Comparison tools provide value
- Performance meets requirements
- User experience is intuitive

## Notes
This feature enables organizations to understand how their compliance efforts apply across multiple frameworks and standards.
