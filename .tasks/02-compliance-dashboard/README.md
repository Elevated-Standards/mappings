# Compliance Dashboard Tasks

This directory contains individual task files for the Compliance Dashboard development project. Each task represents a specific, manageable unit of work that can be assigned to developers and tracked independently.

## Overview

The Compliance Dashboard is a real-time tracking system for control implementation status across NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, and other compliance frameworks. This project is broken down into **67 individual tasks** organized into **9 major categories**.
