# Implement baseline comparison algorithms

**Task ID:** 6VmSJxuKyKHY9iv6EPQsLg  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.1: Gap Detection Engine

## Description
Create algorithms to compare current control implementations against required framework baselines with configurable comparison logic

## Technical Requirements
- Support multiple comparison modes (strict, flexible, custom)
- Handle different control implementation statuses (implemented, partial, planned, etc.)
- Configurable tolerance levels for partial implementations
- Performance optimization for large control sets (1000+ controls)
- Support for control enhancement comparisons
- Framework-agnostic comparison logic with framework-specific adapters

## Tasks
- [ ] Design baseline comparison algorithm architecture
- [ ] Implement strict comparison mode (exact match required)
- [ ] Implement flexible comparison mode (partial implementations accepted)
- [ ] Create custom comparison mode with user-defined rules
- [ ] Add support for control enhancement comparisons
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations for large datasets
- [ ] Create framework-specific comparison adapters
- [ ] Add configurable tolerance thresholds
- [ ] Implement comparison result caching
- [ ] Add comparison audit logging

## Dependencies
- Data Models (fedramp-core)
- Control Mapping Engine
- Framework baseline data from control_mappings.json

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Algorithm can compare 1000+ controls in under 5 seconds
- [ ] Supports all major framework types (NIST 800-53, 800-171, FedRAMP)
- [ ] Configurable comparison modes work correctly
- [ ] Handles edge cases (missing controls, invalid statuses)
- [ ] Produces consistent, reproducible results
- [ ] Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

## Implementation Notes
- Use Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
- Implement using async/await for performance
- Consider using parallel processing for large datasets
- Ensure memory efficiency for large control sets
- Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
