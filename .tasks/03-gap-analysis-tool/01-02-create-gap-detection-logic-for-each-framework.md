# Create gap detection logic for each framework

**Task ID:** 3v28dJMaTUaZg6z6b5C6CF  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.1: Gap Detection Engine

## Description
Implement framework-specific gap detection logic for NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, FedRAMP, and CIS frameworks

## Technical Requirements
- Framework-specific gap detection algorithms
- Support for framework-specific control structures and requirements
- Handle framework versioning (e.g., NIST 800-53 Rev 4 vs Rev 5)
- Framework-specific control enhancement handling
- Support for framework-specific baseline profiles
- Configurable framework-specific rules and thresholds

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement NIST 800-53 Rev 5 gap detection logic
- [ ] Create NIST 800-171 R3 gap detection algorithms
- [ ] Implement FedRAMP baseline-specific gap detection
- [ ] Add CIS Controls framework gap detection
- [ ] Create framework version handling system
- [ ] Implement framework-specific control enhancement detection
- [ ] Add support for framework-specific baseline profiles
- [ ] Create framework rule configuration system
- [ ] Implement framework-specific validation logic
- [ ] Add framework migration gap detection

## Dependencies
- Baseline comparison algorithms
- Framework baseline data from control_mappings.json
- Control Mapping Engine
- Framework catalog data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately detects gaps for each supported framework
- [ ] Handles framework-specific control structures correctly
- [ ] Supports multiple framework versions simultaneously
- [ ] Framework-specific rules are configurable
- [ ] Produces framework-appropriate gap reports
- [ ] Handles framework migration scenarios
- [ ] Includes comprehensive framework validation

## Implementation Notes
- Use trait-based design for framework-specific implementations
- Implement factory pattern for framework detector creation
- Ensure extensibility for future framework additions
- Follow framework-specific naming conventions
- Include framework-specific test datasets
