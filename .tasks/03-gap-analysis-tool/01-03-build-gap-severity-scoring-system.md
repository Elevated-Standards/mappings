# Build gap severity scoring system

**Task ID:** i83EMe96eby6ZjLdzAjRTV  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.1: Gap Detection Engine

## Description
Develop configurable scoring system to assess gap severity based on risk impact, compliance requirements, and business criticality

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm (risk, compliance, business impact)
- Configurable scoring weights and thresholds
- Support for custom scoring criteria
- Normalized scoring scale (0-100 or 1-10)
- Framework-specific severity adjustments
- Historical severity trend tracking
- Performance optimization for bulk scoring

## Tasks
- [ ] Design severity scoring algorithm architecture
- [ ] Implement risk impact scoring component
- [ ] Create compliance requirement severity scoring
- [ ] Add business criticality assessment scoring
- [ ] Implement configurable scoring weights system
- [ ] Create custom scoring criteria support
- [ ] Add framework-specific severity adjustments
- [ ] Implement severity score normalization
- [ ] Create severity threshold configuration
- [ ] Add bulk scoring optimization
- [ ] Implement severity trend tracking
- [ ] Create severity score validation logic

## Dependencies
- Gap detection algorithms
- Risk assessment data integration
- Business impact assessment framework
- Configuration management system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Produces consistent, reproducible severity scores
- [ ] Supports configurable scoring criteria and weights
- [ ] Handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for large datasets
- [ ] Severity scores correlate with actual risk levels
- [ ] Framework-specific adjustments work correctly
- [ ] Includes comprehensive validation and error handling

## Implementation Notes
- Use weighted scoring algorithm with configurable factors
- Implement caching for performance optimization
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent scoring operations
- Include extensive unit tests with known scoring scenarios
- Follow existing scoring patterns in the codebase
- Consider machine learning integration for future enhancements
