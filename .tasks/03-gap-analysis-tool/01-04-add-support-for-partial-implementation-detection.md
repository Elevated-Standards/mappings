# Add support for partial implementation detection

**Task ID:** 9q8CPBVzYNebM8WteHvwVi  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.1: Gap Detection Engine

## Description
Implement logic to detect and assess partial control implementations, distinguishing from complete gaps

## Technical Requirements
- Partial implementation detection algorithms
- Percentage-based implementation assessment
- Support for multiple implementation dimensions (technical, procedural, documentation)
- Configurable partial implementation thresholds
- Integration with existing implementation status tracking
- Support for enhancement-level partial implementations

## Tasks
- [ ] Design partial implementation detection architecture
- [ ] Implement percentage-based assessment algorithms
- [ ] Create multi-dimensional implementation analysis
- [ ] Add technical implementation detection logic
- [ ] Implement procedural implementation assessment
- [ ] Create documentation completeness detection
- [ ] Add configurable threshold management
- [ ] Implement enhancement-level partial detection
- [ ] Create partial implementation scoring
- [ ] Add partial implementation trend tracking
- [ ] Implement validation for partial assessments
- [ ] Create partial implementation reporting

## Dependencies
- Gap detection engine core
- Control implementation status models
- Configuration management system
- Assessment procedure definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately distinguishes partial from complete implementations
- [ ] Supports configurable assessment thresholds
- [ ] Handles multi-dimensional implementation aspects
- [ ] Produces meaningful partial implementation scores
- [ ] Integrates seamlessly with existing gap detection
- [ ] Includes comprehensive validation logic
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for large control sets

## Implementation Notes
- Use composite scoring for multiple implementation dimensions
- Implement fuzzy logic for nuanced partial assessments
- Ensure consistency with existing ImplementationStatus enum
- Include extensive test cases for edge scenarios
- Consider machine learning for improved detection accuracy
- Follow existing assessment patterns in the codebase
