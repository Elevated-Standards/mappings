# Implement gap categorization (missing, partial, outdated)

**Task ID:** ibyx7oteZASFssorG8NRHM  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.1: Gap Detection Engine

## Description
Create categorization system to classify gaps as missing, partially implemented, or outdated implementations

## Technical Requirements
- Comprehensive gap categorization taxonomy
- Support for multiple categorization dimensions
- Automated categorization logic
- Manual categorization override capability
- Category-specific remediation guidance
- Integration with existing gap detection results

## Tasks
- [ ] Define gap categorization taxonomy
- [ ] Implement missing control detection logic
- [ ] Create partial implementation categorization
- [ ] Add outdated implementation detection
- [ ] Implement automated categorization algorithms
- [ ] Create manual categorization override system
- [ ] Add category-specific metadata handling
- [ ] Implement categorization validation logic
- [ ] Create category-based filtering and search
- [ ] Add categorization reporting capabilities
- [ ] Implement category change tracking
- [ ] Create categorization audit trail

## Dependencies
- Gap detection engine
- Partial implementation detection
- Control version tracking system
- Implementation status models

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately categorizes all detected gaps
- [ ] Supports manual override of automated categorization
- [ ] Categories are mutually exclusive and comprehensive
- [ ] Categorization logic is consistent and reproducible
- [ ] Includes validation for categorization accuracy
- [ ] Supports category-based reporting and filtering
- [ ] Maintains audit trail for categorization changes

## Implementation Notes
- Use enum-based categorization for type safety
- Implement rule-based categorization engine
- Ensure extensibility for future category additions
- Include comprehensive test coverage for all categories
- Follow existing categorization patterns in codebase
- Consider hierarchical categorization for complex scenarios
