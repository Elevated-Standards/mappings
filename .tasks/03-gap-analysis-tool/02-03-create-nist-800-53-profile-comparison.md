# Create NIST 800-53 profile comparison

**Task ID:** 1FRfc5wWU3WHEaKNoNVc4R  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.2: Framework Baseline Analysis

## Description
Implement comparison logic for NIST 800-53 Rev 5 profiles and control families

## Technical Requirements
- Support for NIST 800-53 Rev 5 baseline profiles (Low, Moderate, High)
- Control family-based gap analysis
- Control enhancement requirement analysis
- Profile inheritance and overlay support
- Custom profile creation and comparison
- Integration with OSCAL profile formats

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement NIST 800-53 Rev 5 profile loading
- [ ] Create baseline profile comparison algorithms
- [ ] Add control family-based analysis logic
- [ ] Implement control enhancement comparison
- [ ] Create profile inheritance handling
- [ ] Add custom profile support
- [ ] Implement OSCAL profile format integration
- [ ] Create profile overlay analysis
- [ ] Add profile-specific gap scoring
- [ ] Implement profile comparison reporting
- [ ] Create profile recommendation engine
- [ ] Add profile migration analysis

## Dependencies
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 baseline profiles
- OSCAL profile format specifications
- Control family definitions
- Framework baseline loading system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately compares against all NIST 800-53 Rev 5 profiles
- [ ] Handles control family requirements correctly
- [ ] Supports control enhancement analysis
- [ ] Integrates with OSCAL profile formats
- [ ] Supports custom profile creation and comparison
- [ ] Provides meaningful profile-based recommendations
- [ ] Includes comprehensive profile validation

## Implementation Notes
- Use NIST OSCAL profile URLs from control_mappings.json
- Implement profile inheritance logic for overlays
- Support both JSON and XML OSCAL formats
- Include control family taxonomy from mappings
- Follow NIST 800-53 Rev 5 structure and conventions
- Consider performance optimization for large profiles
