# Add NIST 800-171 domain analysis

**Task ID:** vuwDQhobQ4AYoJtLW1FRGt  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.2: Framework Baseline Analysis

## Description
Implement domain-specific gap analysis for NIST 800-171 R3 requirements

## Technical Requirements
- Support for all 14 NIST 800-171 R3 security domains
- Domain-specific control requirement analysis
- CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) protection focus
- Integration with NIST 800-53 control mappings
- Support for NIST 800-171 assessment procedures
- Domain-based gap prioritization

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement NIST 800-171 R3 domain structure
- [ ] Create domain-specific gap analysis logic
- [ ] Add CUI protection requirement analysis
- [ ] Implement domain-based control mapping
- [ ] Create NIST 800-171 assessment procedure integration
- [ ] Add domain-specific gap scoring
- [ ] Implement domain prioritization logic
- [ ] Create domain-based remediation guidance
- [ ] Add NIST 800-171 compliance scoring
- [ ] Implement domain gap trend analysis
- [ ] Create domain-specific reporting
- [ ] Add NIST 800-171 readiness assessment

## Dependencies
- NIST 800-171 R3 domain definitions from control_mappings.json
- NIST 800-53 to 800-171 control mappings
- CUI protection requirements
- Assessment procedure definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately analyzes gaps for all 14 NIST 800-171 domains
- [ ] Handles CUI protection requirements correctly
- [ ] Integrates with NIST 800-53 control mappings
- [ ] Supports domain-based gap prioritization
- [ ] Provides domain-specific remediation guidance
- [ ] Includes NIST 800-171 compliance assessment
- [ ] Produces domain-specific gap reports

## Implementation Notes
- Use domain structure from control_mappings.json (3.1-3.14)
- Implement CUI-focused gap analysis logic
- Include NIST 800-171 assessment procedures
- Consider contractor vs. federal agency requirements
- Follow NIST 800-171 R3 structure and terminology
- Include domain-specific test scenarios
