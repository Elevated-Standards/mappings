# Implement risk scoring algorithms

**Task ID:** ribmXPX6ZZZ6Fm24AJhFZ3  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.4: Risk-Based Gap Prioritization

## Description
Create algorithms to score gaps based on risk impact, threat likelihood, and business criticality

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-factor risk scoring algorithm (impact, likelihood, criticality)
- Integration with existing risk assessment data
- Configurable risk scoring models
- Support for qualitative and quantitative risk metrics
- Risk score normalization and calibration
- Historical risk trend analysis

## Tasks
- [ ] Design risk scoring algorithm architecture
- [ ] Implement impact assessment scoring
- [ ] Create threat likelihood evaluation
- [ ] Add business criticality assessment
- [ ] Implement configurable risk models
- [ ] Create qualitative risk scoring support
- [ ] Add quantitative risk metrics integration
- [ ] Implement risk score normalization
- [ ] Create risk score calibration system
- [ ] Add historical risk trend analysis
- [ ] Implement risk scoring validation
- [ ] Create risk scoring audit trail

## Dependencies
- Risk assessment platform integration
- Threat intelligence data
- Business impact assessment framework
- Historical risk data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Produces accurate and consistent risk scores
- [ ] Integrates with existing risk assessment data
- [ ] Supports both qualitative and quantitative metrics
- [ ] Risk scores correlate with actual business impact
- [ ] Includes configurable risk scoring models
- [ ] Provides risk score validation and calibration
- [ ] Maintains comprehensive audit trail

## Implementation Notes
- Use CVSS-like scoring methodology adapted for compliance gaps
- Implement weighted scoring with configurable factors
- Include Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis
- Support both deterministic and probabilistic scoring
- Follow existing risk assessment patterns in codebase
- Consider integration with external threat intelligence feeds
