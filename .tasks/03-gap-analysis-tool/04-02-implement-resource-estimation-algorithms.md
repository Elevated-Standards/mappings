**Task ID:** pip2VSsVHhxguyEuRkQyYW  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.5: Gap Remediation Planning

## Description
Create algorithms to estimate personnel, budget, and technical resources needed for remediation

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-dimensional resource estimation (personnel, budget, technology)
- Skill-based resource allocation algorithms
- Resource availability and constraint analysis
- Historical data-based estimation models
- Resource optimization and allocation logic
- Integration with project management tools

## Tasks
- [ ] Design resource estimation framework
- [ ] Implement personnel resource estimation

- [ ] Add technical resource requirement analysis
- [ ] Implement skill-based allocation logic
- [ ] Create resource availability analysis
- [ ] Add resource constraint handling
- [ ] Implement historical data integration
- [ ] Create resource optimization algorithms
- [ ] Add resource allocation validation
- [ ] Implement resource estimation reporting
- [ ] Create resource planning integration

## Dependencies
- Implementation effort estimation
- Organizational resource data
- Skill and expertise databases
- Historical project data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately estimates all resource types needed
- [ ] Considers skill requirements and availability
