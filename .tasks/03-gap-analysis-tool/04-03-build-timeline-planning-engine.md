## Technical Requirements
- Critical path method (CPM) implementation
- Dependency analysis and scheduling
- Resource-constrained scheduling
- Timeline optimization algorithms
- Milestone and checkpoint management
- Integration with calendar and scheduling systems

## Tasks
- [ ] Design timeline planning architecture
- [ ] Implement critical path method algorithms
- [ ] Create dependency analysis logic
- [ ] Add resource-constrained scheduling
- [ ] Implement timeline optimization
- [ ] Create milestone management system
- [ ] Add calendar integration capabilities
- [ ] Implement schedule conflict resolution
- [ ] Create timeline visualization
- [ ] Add timeline adjustment capabilities
- [ ] Implement timeline validation logic
- [ ] Create timeline reporting features

## Dependencies
- Resource estimation algorithms
- Dependency analysis system
- Calendar and scheduling integration
- Project management frameworks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Creates realistic and achievable timelines
- [ ] Handles complex dependency relationships
- [ ] Considers resource availability and constraints
- [ ] Optimizes timeline for efficiency and risk
- [ ] Supports milestone and checkpoint management
- [ ] Integrates with existing scheduling systems
- [ ] Provides timeline visualization and reporting

## Implementation Notes
- Use project scheduling algorithms (CPM, PERT)
- Implement resource leveling and smoothing
- Support both forward and backward scheduling
- Include buffer time for risk management
- Consider organizational calendar constraints
- Implement timeline sensitivity analysis
