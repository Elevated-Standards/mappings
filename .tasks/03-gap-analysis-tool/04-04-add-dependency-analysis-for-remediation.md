# Add dependency analysis for remediation

**Task ID:** gRm3WwVZntrDrXa8DHuYyG  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.5: Gap Remediation Planning

## Description
Implement analysis of remediation dependencies to optimize implementation sequencing

## Technical Requirements
- Dependency graph construction and analysis
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Dependency impact analysis
- Sequencing optimization algorithms
- Dependency constraint management
- Integration with control relationships

## Tasks
- [ ] Design dependency analysis framework
- [ ] Implement dependency graph construction
- [ ] Create circular dependency detection
- [ ] Add dependency impact analysis
- [ ] Implement sequencing optimization
- [ ] Create dependency constraint handling
- [ ] Add control relationship integration
- [ ] Implement dependency validation logic
- [ ] Create dependency visualization
- [ ] Add dependency change impact analysis
- [ ] Implement dependency reporting
- [ ] Create dependency management interface

## Dependencies
- Control mapping relationships
- Gap detection results
- Timeline planning engine
- Graph analysis libraries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately identifies all remediation dependencies
- [ ] Detects and resolves circular dependencies
- [ ] Optimizes remediation sequencing
- [ ] Handles complex dependency relationships
- [ ] Integrates with control mapping data
- [ ] Provides dependency visualization
- [ ] Supports dependency change management

## Implementation Notes
- Use directed acyclic graph (DAG) for dependency modeling
- Implement topological sorting for sequencing
- Include dependency strength weighting
- Support both hard and soft dependencies
- Consider resource and timeline constraints
- Implement dependency conflict resolution
