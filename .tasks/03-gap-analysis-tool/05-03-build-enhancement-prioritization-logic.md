**Task ID:** 6wzHiwiMAk1JMYScjxwWrB  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.3: Control Enhancement Gap Analysis

## Description
Implement prioritization system for control enhancement implementation based on risk and compliance

## Technical Requirements
- Enhancement-specific prioritization criteria
- Risk-based enhancement scoring
- Compliance impact assessment for enhancements
- Enhancement implementation effort consideration
- Integration with overall gap prioritization
- Support for enhancement grouping and bundling

## Tasks
- [ ] Design enhancement prioritization framework
- [ ] Implement risk-based enhancement scoring
- [ ] Create compliance impact assessment
- [ ] Add implementation effort consideration
- [ ] Implement enhancement grouping logic
- [ ] Create enhancement bundling optimization
- [ ] Add prioritization criteria weighting
- [ ] Implement enhancement priority validation
- [ ] Create enhancement priority reporting
- [ ] Add priority adjustment capabilities
- [ ] Implement enhancement priority tracking
- [ ] Create enhancement priority analytics

## Dependencies
- Enhancement gap detection
- Risk scoring algorithms
- Implementation effort estimation
- Compliance impact assessment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prioritizes enhancements based on multiple criteria
- [ ] Considers risk, compliance, and effort factors
