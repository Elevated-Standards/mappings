# Add enhancement dependency tracking

**Task ID:** jy6sfc4L5CtLswfaWhN9Ad  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.3: Control Enhancement Gap Analysis

## Description
Track dependencies between control enhancements and base controls for proper implementation sequencing

## Technical Requirements
- Enhancement-to-control dependency mapping
- Enhancement-to-enhancement dependency tracking
- Dependency impact analysis for enhancements
- Sequencing optimization for enhancement implementation
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Integration with overall dependency analysis

## Tasks
- [ ] Design enhancement dependency framework
- [ ] Implement enhancement-control dependency mapping
- [ ] Create enhancement-enhancement dependency tracking
- [ ] Add dependency impact analysis
- [ ] Implement sequencing optimization
- [ ] Create circular dependency detection
- [ ] Add dependency validation logic
- [ ] Implement dependency visualization
- [ ] Create dependency change impact analysis
- [ ] Add dependency conflict resolution
- [ ] Implement dependency reporting
- [ ] Create dependency management interface

## Dependencies
- Control enhancement definitions
- Base control dependency analysis
- Enhancement requirement analysis
- Dependency graph infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately tracks all enhancement dependencies
- [ ] Maps dependencies to base controls
- [ ] Handles enhancement-to-enhancement dependencies
- [ ] Optimizes enhancement implementation sequencing
- [ ] Detects and resolves circular dependencies
- [ ] Provides dependency visualization
- [ ] Supports dependency change management

## Implementation Notes
- Use directed graph for dependency modeling
- Implement dependency strength weighting
- Support both hard and soft dependencies
- Include dependency validation rules
- Consider enhancement implementation complexity
- Implement dependency conflict resolution algorithms
