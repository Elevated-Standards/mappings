# Implement cross-framework gap detection

**Task ID:** izMjFdw36wK5Nj4ickeFFc  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Parent Task:** 3.6: Cross-Framework Gap Analysis

## Description
Create detection logic to identify gaps that span multiple security frameworks simultaneously

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-framework gap correlation analysis
- Framework overlap and intersection detection
- Unified gap identification across frameworks
- Cross-framework gap severity assessment
- Integration with individual framework gap detection
- Support for framework-specific gap weighting

## Tasks
- [ ] Design cross-framework detection architecture
- [ ] Implement framework correlation analysis
- [ ] Create overlap detection algorithms
- [ ] Add intersection gap identification
- [ ] Implement unified gap assessment
- [ ] Create cross-framework severity scoring
- [ ] Add framework weighting support
- [ ] Implement gap deduplication logic
- [ ] Create cross-framework validation
- [ ] Add gap correlation reporting
- [ ] Implement cross-framework analytics
- [ ] Create framework comparison capabilities

## Dependencies
- Individual framework gap detection
- Control mapping engine
- Framework overlap analysis
- Gap severity scoring system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately identifies gaps across multiple frameworks
- [ ] Handles framework overlaps and intersections
- [ ] Provides unified gap assessment
- [ ] Supports framework-specific weighting
- [ ] Eliminates duplicate gap identification
- [ ] Includes cross-framework validation
- [ ] Supports framework comparison analysis

## Implementation Notes
