# Control Mapping Engine Implementation

**Task ID:** 7XV1jwXXdz2WFdURMC6kCT  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 8 weeks  

## Description
Complete implementation of the control mapping engine for cross-framework security control analysis. This engine will maintain relationships between security controls across multiple frameworks (NIST 800-53 Rev 5, NIST 800-171 R3, CIS Controls), enabling cross-framework analysis, compliance tracking, and unified security management.

## Objectives
- Support 5+ major security frameworks
- Maintain 95%+ mapping accuracy
- Handle 10,000+ control relationships
- Provide mapping queries in <1 second
- Support real-time mapping updates
- Enable custom framework integration
- Maintain mapping quality scores >90%

## Prerequisites
- Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- Existing mapping files: `control_mappings.json`
- External framework catalogs and profiles

## Dependencies
- Data Models (1.2)
- Configuration Management (1.5)
- API Framework (1.4)

## Integration Points
### With Gap Analysis Tool
- Provide framework mappings for gap detection
- Support cross-framework gap analysis
- Enable mapping-based recommendations

### With Compliance Dashboard
- Supply mapping data for multi-framework views
- Enable framework comparison features
- Support unified compliance reporting

### With Multi-Framework Converter
- Provide mapping rules for conversions
- Support framework translation
- Enable mapping-based transformations

### With SSP Generator
- Use mappings for control selection
- Support framework-specific SSP generation
- Enable cross-framework documentation

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Foundation Components
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** NIST Framework Integration
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Extended Framework Support
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):** Quality Assurance & API

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All framework catalogs successfully loaded and validated
- [ ] Cross-framework mappings implemented with confidence scoring
- [ ] API endpoints functional with sub-second response times
- [ ] Quality assurance system operational with >90% scores
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite passing with >95% coverage
- [ ] Integration with other system components verified

## Deliverables
- Framework catalog management system
- Control relationship mapping database
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 integration
- NIST 800-171 R3 integration
- CIS Controls v8 integration
- Custom framework support
- Mapping quality assurance system
- RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- Complete testing and validation suite

## Notes
This is the master task that encompasses all control mapping engine development. Individual phase and component tasks are tracked separately with detailed specifications and requirements.
