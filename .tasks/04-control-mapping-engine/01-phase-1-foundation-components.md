# Phase 1: Foundation Components

**Task ID:** jrTMdmeSUNaRbGE12nbhsS  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Parent Task:** Control Mapping Engine Implementation

## Description
Establish the foundational components for the control mapping engine including framework catalog management and basic control relationships. This phase creates the core infrastructure needed for all subsequent framework integrations.

## Objectives
- Implement OSCAL catalog parsing capabilities
- Create robust framework catalog storage system
- Build control relationship mapping infrastructure
- Establish mapping confidence scoring system
- Enable bidirectional mapping validation

## Components
### Framework Catalog Management
- OSCAL catalog parser implementation
- Framework catalog storage design
- Catalog versioning system
- Automatic catalog updates from NIST
- Catalog validation and integrity checks
- Catalog comparison tools

### Control Relationship Mapping
- Load existing mappings from control_mappings.json
- Control relationship database design
- Mapping confidence scoring algorithm
- Control family relationship tracking
- Enhancement mapping support
- Bidirectional mapping validation

## Technical Requirements
- Support OSCAL catalog format
- Handle framework versioning
- Support many-to-many relationships
- Maintain mapping confidence scores
- Handle control families and enhancements

## Dependencies
- Data Models (1.2)
- Configuration Management (1.5)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] OSCAL catalog parser functional and tested
- [ ] Framework catalog storage operational
- [ ] Control relationship database implemented
- [ ] Mapping confidence scoring working
- [ ] Existing mappings successfully imported
- [ ] Bidirectional validation system active

## Deliverables
- OSCAL catalog parser module
- Framework catalog storage system
- Control relationship database schema
- Mapping confidence scoring algorithm
- Catalog versioning and update system
- Mapping validation framework

## Notes
This phase establishes the critical foundation that all other phases depend on. Quality and robustness here are essential for the entire system's success.
