# Phase 2: NIST Framework Integration

**Task ID:** tXsRHag8DAbHedKjdjjKWo  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Parent Task:** Control Mapping Engine Implementation

## Description
Integrate NIST 800-53 Rev 5 and NIST 800-171 R3 frameworks with full catalog support and baseline profiles. This phase implements comprehensive support for the two primary NIST security frameworks.

## Objectives
- Full NIST 800-53 Rev 5 catalog integration
- Complete NIST 800-171 R3 requirements support
- Baseline profile implementation (Low/Moderate/High)
- Control family and enhancement hierarchy
- Cross-framework mapping between NIST standards

## Components
### NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Integration
- Complete catalog integration
- Baseline profile support (Low/Moderate/High)
- Control family structure implementation
- Enhancement hierarchy mapping
- Control parameter support
- Assessment procedure mapping

### NIST 800-171 R3 Integration
- Full requirements integration
- 14-domain organizational structure
- Mapping to 800-53 controls
- CUI protection requirement tracking
- Assessment objective mapping
- Maturity level support

## Technical Requirements
- Full NIST 800-53 Rev 5 catalog support
- Baseline profile integration
- Control family organization
- Enhancement hierarchy management
- NIST 800-171 R3 domain support
