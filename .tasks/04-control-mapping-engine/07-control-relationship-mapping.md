# Control Relationship Mapping

**Task ID:** 62EaPFX7JTtnaMYU4wJbW5  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days  
**Parent Task:** Phase 1: Foundation Components

## Description
Build control relationship database with many-to-many mappings, confidence scoring, and bidirectional validation. This component manages the complex relationships between controls across different security frameworks.

## Objectives
- Import existing control mappings
- Create robust relationship database
- Implement confidence scoring system
- Track control family relationships
- Support control enhancements
- Ensure bidirectional mapping consistency

## Technical Requirements
- Map controls across frameworks
- Support many-to-many relationships
- Handle control families and enhancements
- Maintain mapping confidence scores
- Bidirectional mapping validation
- Import existing mapping data

## Subtasks
1. **Load Existing Control Mappings**
   - Import mappings from control_mappings.json
   - Parse and validate existing data
   - Migrate to new database structure

2. **Implement Control Relationship Database**
   - Design many-to-many relationship schema
   - Create control mapping data models
   - Implement relationship storage and retrieval

3. **Create Mapping Confidence Scoring**
   - Develop confidence scoring algorithm
   - Track mapping reliability metrics
   - Implement scoring updates and maintenance

4. **Build Control Family Relationship Tracking**
   - Track relationships between control families
   - Implement family hierarchy management
   - Create family-level mapping capabilities

5. **Add Enhancement Mapping Support**
   - Support control enhancement relationships
   - Track enhancement hierarchies
   - Implement enhancement-specific mappings

6. **Implement Bidirectional Mapping Validation**
   - Ensure mapping consistency in both directions
   - Validate relationship integrity
   - Detect and report mapping conflicts

## Dependencies
- Framework Catalog Management
- Existing control_mappings.json file

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Existing mappings successfully imported
- [ ] Relationship database operational
- [ ] Confidence scoring functional
- [ ] Family relationships tracked
- [ ] Enhancement mappings supported
- [ ] Bidirectional validation active

## Deliverables
- Control relationship database schema
- Mapping import/migration tools
- Confidence scoring algorithm
- Family relationship tracker
- Enhancement mapping system
- Bidirectional validation framework

## Notes
This component forms the core of the mapping engine's functionality. The quality and accuracy of these relationships directly impact all other system capabilities.
