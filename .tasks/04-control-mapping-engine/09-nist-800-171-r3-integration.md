# NIST 800-171 R3 Integration

**Task ID:** rRHPdkkqX9CkL23EyDbug9  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Parent Task:** Phase 2: NIST Framework Integration

## Description
Integrate NIST 800-171 R3 requirements with domain organization, CUI protection, and 800-53 mappings. This component provides support for the federal contractor security framework.

## Objectives
- Complete NIST 800-171 R3 requirements integration
- Implement 14-domain organizational structure
- Create comprehensive mappings to 800-53 controls
- Support CUI protection requirements
- Integrate assessment objectives and maturity levels

## Technical Requirements
- NIST 800-171 R3 domain support
- CUI protection requirements
- Mapping to 800-53 controls
- Assessment methodology integration
- Maturity level support

## Subtasks
1. **Integrate NIST 800-171 R3 Requirements**
   - Load all 800-171 R3 requirements
   - Process requirement specifications
   - Import guidance and implementation details

2. **Implement Domain-Based Organization**
   - Create 14-domain structure
   - Organize requirements by domain
   - Support domain-based navigation

3. **Create 800-171 to 800-53 Mappings**
   - Map requirements to 800-53 controls
   - Implement comprehensive cross-references
   - Validate mapping accuracy

4. **Add CUI Protection Requirement Tracking**
   - Track Controlled Unclassified Information requirements
   - Implement CUI-specific controls
   - Support CUI protection workflows

5. **Build Assessment Objective Mapping**
   - Integrate assessment objectives
   - Map objectives to requirements
   - Support assessment procedures

6. **Implement Maturity Level Support**
   - Add maturity level framework
   - Support implementation guidance
   - Track maturity progression

## Dependencies
- Framework Catalog Management
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 800-171 R3 requirements loaded
- [ ] 14-domain structure operational
- [ ] 800-53 mappings validated
- [ ] CUI protection tracking active
- [ ] Assessment objectives integrated
- [ ] Maturity levels supported

## Deliverables
- NIST 800-171 R3 integration
- Domain-based organization system
- Cross-framework mapping database
- CUI protection tracking system
- Assessment objective framework
- Maturity level support system

## Notes
This integration is essential for federal contractor compliance. The mappings to 800-53 must be accurate and officially validated.
