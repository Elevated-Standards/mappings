   - Support priority-based filtering

4. **Map CIS to NIST Frameworks**
   - Create mappings to NIST 800-53
   - Create mappings to NIST 800-171
   - Validate cross-framework relationships

5. **Add Asset Type Relationship Tracking**
   - Track asset types and relationships
   - Map controls to asset categories
   - Support asset-based control selection

6. **Build CIS Assessment Guidance**
   - Integrate assessment procedures
