# Create Framework Catalog Storage

**Task ID:** 8piyzYwNoP9RiYXWtL2GAt  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 1 day  
**Parent Task:** Framework Catalog Management

## Description
Design and implement database schema and storage system for framework catalogs. This system will store parsed catalog data in a structured, queryable format.

## Objectives
- Design efficient database schema for catalogs
- Implement catalog storage and retrieval
- Support multiple framework types
- Enable fast catalog queries
- Maintain data integrity and relationships

## Technical Requirements
- Relational database schema design
- Support for multiple catalog formats
- Efficient storage and indexing
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Scalable storage architecture

## Implementation Details
### Database Schema Components
- Catalog metadata tables
- Control definition storage
- Parameter and guidance tables
- Relationship mapping tables
- Version tracking tables

### Storage Features
- Efficient indexing for fast queries
- Foreign key constraints for integrity
- Optimized storage for large catalogs
- Support for catalog versioning
- Backup and recovery capabilities

### Data Models
- Catalog entity model
- Control definition model
- Parameter and guidance models
- Relationship models
- Version tracking models

## Dependencies
- Database management system
- OSCAL catalog parser
- Data model definitions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database schema designed and implemented
- [ ] Catalog storage operations functional
- [ ] Data retrieval queries optimized
- [ ] Data integrity constraints active
- [ ] Version tracking operational
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Deliverables
- Database schema scripts
- Storage interface modules
- Data access layer
- Migration scripts
- Performance optimization

## Testing Requirements
- Test with large catalog datasets
- Validate data integrity constraints
- Performance testing for queries
- Test backup and recovery procedures

## Notes
This storage system must be highly performant as it will be queried frequently by all other components.
