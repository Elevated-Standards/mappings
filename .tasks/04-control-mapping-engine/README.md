# Control Mapping Engine - Task Breakdown

This directory contains the complete task breakdown for the Control Mapping Engine implementation, derived from `.github/tasks/04-control-mapping-engine.md`.

## Overview

The Control Mapping Engine is a sophisticated system that maintains relationships between security controls across multiple frameworks (NIST 800-53 Rev 5, NIST 800-171 R3, CIS Controls), enabling cross-framework analysis, compliance tracking, and unified security management.

## Task Structure

### Total Tasks: 77 Individual Tasks
- **1 Root Task**: Overall project coordination
- **5 Phase Tasks**: Major implementation phases
- **12 Component Tasks**: Functional components
- **59 Detailed Subtasks**: Specific implementation tasks

## Notes

Each task file contains detailed specifications, technical requirements, dependencies, success criteria, and deliverables. Tasks are designed to be manageable units of work (approximately 20 minutes to 2 hours each) that can be assigned to individual developers or small teams.

The task breakdown maintains logical dependencies and enables parallel development where possible while ensuring proper integration points between components.
