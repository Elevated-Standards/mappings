# 5.1.2: Create Information Type Classification

Build information type classification system with hierarchy and classification rules engine.

## Overview
Develop a comprehensive information type classification system that organizes information types hierarchically and implements classification rules for automated categorization.

## Technical Requirements
- Information type hierarchy structure
- Classification rules engine
- Custom type support framework
- Automated classification logic
- Type relationship management
- Validation and consistency checking

## Implementation Details
- Design hierarchical information type structure
- Implement classification rules engine
- Create type inheritance mechanisms
- Build automated classification workflows
- Add custom information type support
- Implement consistency validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hierarchical information type structure created
- [ ] Classification rules engine implemented
- [ ] Custom type support functional
- [ ] Automated classification working
- [ ] Type relationships managed properly
- [ ] Validation rules enforced

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for classification logic
- Integration tests with FIPS 199 algorithms
- Performance tests for large type hierarchies
- Validation tests for type consistency

## Dependencies
- NIST SP 800-60 information types
- FIPS 199 categorization algorithms
- Data model definitions

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours**
