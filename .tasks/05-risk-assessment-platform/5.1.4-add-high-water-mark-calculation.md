# 5.1.4: Add High Water Mark Calculation

Implement high water mark calculation for multi-system aggregation and impact level propagation.

## Overview
Develop high water mark calculation logic that aggregates impact levels across multiple systems and components, ensuring the highest impact level is properly propagated throughout the system categorization.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-system aggregation logic
- Impact level propagation algorithms
- High water mark determination
- Override handling mechanisms
- Aggregation rule enforcement
- Audit trail maintenance

## Implementation Details
- Implement high water mark calculation algorithms
- Create multi-system aggregation logic
- Build impact level propagation mechanisms
- Add override handling capabilities
- Develop aggregation rule enforcement
- Create audit trail for calculations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] High water mark calculation implemented
- [ ] Multi-system aggregation functional
- [ ] Impact level propagation working
- [ ] Override mechanisms operational
- [ ] Aggregation rules enforced
- [ ] Audit trail maintained

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for calculation algorithms
- Integration tests with CIA determination
- Performance tests for large system sets
- Validation tests for aggregation accuracy

## Dependencies
