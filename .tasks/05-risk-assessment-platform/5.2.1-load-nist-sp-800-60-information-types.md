# 5.2.1: Load NIST SP 800-60 Information Types

Import and integrate NIST SP 800-60 information types into the system.

## Overview
Import the complete NIST SP 800-60 information type catalog into the system, ensuring proper data structure, relationships, and integration with the categorization engine.

## Technical Requirements
- NIST SP 800-60 data import capabilities
- Information type data structure
- Relationship mapping
- Data validation and verification
- Integration with categorization engine
- Update and synchronization mechanisms

## Implementation Details
- Create NIST SP 800-60 data import utilities
- Design information type data structures
- Implement relationship mapping logic
- Add data validation and verification
- Build integration with categorization engine
- Create update and synchronization mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NIST SP 800-60 data successfully imported
- [ ] Information type structures properly defined
- [ ] Relationships correctly mapped
- [ ] Data validation functional
- [ ] Integration with categorization working
- [ ] Update mechanisms operational

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for data import utilities
- Integration tests with categorization engine
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Validation tests for data accuracy

## Dependencies
- NIST SP 800-60 information type catalog
- Data model definitions
- FIPS 199 categorization engine

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours**
