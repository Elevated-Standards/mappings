# 5.2.2: Implement Information Type Hierarchy

Build hierarchical structure for information types with parent-child relationships.

## Overview
Develop a hierarchical structure for organizing information types with proper parent-child relationships, inheritance mechanisms, and navigation capabilities.

## Technical Requirements
- Hierarchical data structure design
- Parent-child relationship management
- Inheritance mechanisms
- Navigation and traversal capabilities
- Hierarchy validation
- Performance optimization

## Implementation Details
- Design hierarchical data structures
- Implement parent-child relationship management
- Create inheritance mechanisms
- Build navigation and traversal capabilities
- Add hierarchy validation logic
- Optimize for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hierarchical structure implemented
- [ ] Parent-child relationships functional
- [ ] Inheritance mechanisms working
- [ ] Navigation capabilities operational
- [ ] Hierarchy validation active
- [ ] Performance optimized

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for hierarchy logic
- Integration tests with information types
- Performance tests for deep hierarchies
- Validation tests for relationship integrity

## Dependencies
- NIST SP 800-60 information types
- Data model definitions
- Information type classification

## Estimated Effort
**8-10 hours**
