# 5.3.2: Create Component Impact Aggregation

Implement logic to aggregate impact assessments across system components.

## Overview
Develop logic for aggregating individual component impact assessments into comprehensive system-level impact scores, considering component relationships and dependencies.

## Technical Requirements
- Component impact aggregation algorithms
- Dependency-aware aggregation
- Weighted impact calculations
- Aggregation rule enforcement
- Performance optimization
- Audit trail maintenance

## Implementation Details
- Implement component impact aggregation algorithms
- Create dependency-aware aggregation logic
- Build weighted impact calculations
- Add aggregation rule enforcement
- Optimize for performance
- Maintain audit trails

## Acceptance Criteria
