# 5.3.4: Add Environmental Factor Assessment

Incorporate environmental factors into impact analysis (location, infrastructure, etc.).

## Overview
Develop capabilities to incorporate environmental factors such as physical location, infrastructure characteristics, and operational environment into impact analysis.

## Technical Requirements
- Environmental factor identification
- Factor impact assessment logic
- Location-based analysis
- Infrastructure consideration
- Operational environment factors
- Factor weighting mechanisms

## Implementation Details
- Implement environmental factor identification
- Create factor impact assessment logic
- Build location-based analysis
- Add infrastructure consideration
- Include operational environment factors
- Create factor weighting mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Environmental factors identified
- [ ] Factor impact assessment functional
- [ ] Location-based analysis operational
- [ ] Infrastructure consideration active
- [ ] Operational factors included
- [ ] Factor weighting working

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for factor assessment
- Integration tests with impact calculations
- Performance tests for factor processing
- Validation tests for factor accuracy

## Dependencies
- System impact calculation
- Environmental data sources
- Location and infrastructure data

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours**
