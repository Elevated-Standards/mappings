# 5.4.5: Implement Risk Aggregation Algorithms

Build algorithms to aggregate risks across components, systems, and organizational levels.

## Overview
Develop sophisticated risk aggregation algorithms that combine risks across multiple components, systems, and organizational levels to provide comprehensive risk views.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-level risk aggregation
- Component risk combination
- System-level aggregation
- Organizational risk rollup
- Weighted aggregation support
- Aggregation validation

## Implementation Details
- Implement multi-level risk aggregation
- Create component risk combination
- Build system-level aggregation
- Add organizational risk rollup
- Create weighted aggregation support
- Add aggregation validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-level aggregation implemented
- [ ] Component combination functional
- [ ] System-level aggregation operational
- [ ] Organizational rollup working
- [ ] Weighted aggregation supported
- [ ] Aggregation validation active

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for aggregation algorithms
- Integration tests with risk calculations
- Performance tests for large aggregations
- Validation tests for aggregation accuracy

## Dependencies
- Residual risk analysis
- System architecture data
- Organizational structure data

## Estimated Effort
**8-10 hours**
