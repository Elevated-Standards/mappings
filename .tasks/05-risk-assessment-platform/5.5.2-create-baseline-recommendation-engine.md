# 5.5.2: Create Baseline Recommendation Engine

Implement system to recommend baseline security controls based on system categorization.

## Overview
Develop a baseline recommendation engine that suggests appropriate baseline security controls based on FIPS 199 system categorization and applicable security frameworks.

## Technical Requirements
- Baseline control mapping
- Categorization-based recommendations
- Framework-specific baselines
- Customization capabilities
- Recommendation prioritization
- Compliance verification

## Implementation Details
- Implement baseline control mapping
- Create categorization-based recommendations
- Build framework-specific baselines
- Add customization capabilities
- Create recommendation prioritization
- Add compliance verification

## Acceptance Criteria
