# 5.6.2: Create Attack Vector Analysis

Implement analysis of potential attack vectors and attack paths through system architecture.

## Overview
Develop attack vector analysis capabilities that identify potential attack paths through system architecture, analyze attack surface exposure, and map attack progression routes.

## Technical Requirements
- Attack vector identification
- Attack path mapping
- Attack surface analysis
- Progression route modeling
- Vector prioritization
- Mitigation mapping

## Implementation Details
- Implement attack vector identification
- Create attack path mapping
- Build attack surface analysis
- Add progression route modeling
- Create vector prioritization
- Add mitigation mapping

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Attack vector identification implemented
- [ ] Attack path mapping functional
- [ ] Attack surface analysis operational
- [ ] Progression route modeling working
- [ ] Vector prioritization active
- [ ] Mitigation mapping available

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for vector analysis
- Integration tests with threat actor profiling
- Performance tests for path mapping
- Validation tests for vector accuracy

## Dependencies
- Threat actor profiling
- System architecture data
- Attack pattern databases

## Estimated Effort
**8-10 hours**
