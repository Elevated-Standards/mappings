# 5.6.4: Add Impact Pathway Analysis

Analyze pathways through which threats can impact system components and business operations.

## Overview
Develop impact pathway analysis capabilities that trace how threats can propagate through system components to affect business operations and organizational objectives.

## Technical Requirements
- Impact pathway mapping
- Propagation analysis
- Business impact correlation
- Component vulnerability assessment
- Pathway prioritization
- Mitigation pathway identification

## Implementation Details
- Implement impact pathway mapping
- Create propagation analysis
- Build business impact correlation
- Add component vulnerability assessment
- Create pathway prioritization
- Add mitigation pathway identification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Impact pathway mapping implemented
- [ ] Propagation analysis functional
- [ ] Business impact correlation operational
- [ ] Component vulnerability assessment working
- [ ] Pathway prioritization active
- [ ] Mitigation pathway identification available

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for pathway analysis
- Integration tests with threat scenario modeling
