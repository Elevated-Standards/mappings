# 6.1: POA&M Data Management

## Overview
Implement OSCAL POA&M data model with FedRAMP v3.0 compliance, vulnerability lifecycle tracking, data validation and integrity checks. This component forms the foundation of the POA&M management system by providing robust data structures and operations.

## Technical Requirements
- OSCAL POA&M data model implementation
- FedRAMP POA&M v3.0 compliance
- Vulnerability lifecycle tracking
- Data validation and integrity
- CRUD operations with error handling
- Version control system for POA&M items

## Implementation Details

### Data Model Structure
- Implement OSCAL POA&M schema compliance
- Support for vulnerability metadata and tracking
- Remediation plan data structures
- Timeline and milestone tracking
- Risk assessment integration points
- Audit trail and change history

### Validation Framework
- Schema validation against OSCAL standards
- Business rule validation
- Data integrity constraints
- Cross-reference validation
- Custom validation rules support

### Lifecycle Management
- State machine for vulnerability lifecycle
- Transition validation and logging
- Automated state updates
- Manual override capabilities
- History preservation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OSCAL POA&M data model fully implemented
- [ ] All CRUD operations working with validation
- [ ] Data validation using poam_mappings.json
- [ ] Vulnerability lifecycle state management operational
- [ ] Data integrity checks implemented
- [ ] Version control system functional
- [ ] FedRAMP v3.0 compliance verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (1000+ POA&M items)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Data model validation tests
- CRUD operation tests
- State transition tests
- Validation rule tests
- Version control tests

### Integration Tests
- Database integration tests
- Schema validation tests
- Cross-system data flow tests
- Performance tests with large datasets

### Compliance Tests
- FedRAMP v3.0 format validation
- OSCAL schema compliance
- Data integrity verification

## Dependencies
- Data Models (1.2)
- POA&M Document Processor
- Database infrastructure
- OSCAL schema definitions
- poam_mappings.json configuration

## Estimated Effort
**3-4 days** (24-32 hours)

## Priority
**High** - Foundation component required for all other POA&M functionality

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing poam_mappings.json for field validation
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Design for scalability and performance
- Follow OSCAL best practices and guidelines
