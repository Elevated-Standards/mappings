# 6.1.4: Add Vulnerability Lifecycle State Management

## Overview
Create state machine for vulnerability lifecycle management with proper transitions, validation, and audit logging.

## Technical Requirements
- State machine implementation
- Transition validation
- Audit logging
- State persistence
- Event handling
- Rollback capabilities

## Implementation Details

### State Definitions
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum VulnerabilityState {
    New,
    InProgress,
    UnderReview,
    Remediated,
    Verified,
    Closed,
    Reopened,
    Deferred,
    Accepted,
}

pub struct StateTransition {
    pub from: VulnerabilityState,
    pub to: VulnerabilityState,
    pub trigger: TransitionTrigger,
    pub conditions: Vec<TransitionCondition>,
    pub actions: Vec<TransitionAction>,
}
```

### State Machine Engine
- Valid transition enforcement
- Condition evaluation
- Action execution
- Event emission
- State persistence
- Rollback support

### Transition Validation
- Permission-based validation
- Business rule validation
- Prerequisite checking
- Dependency validation
- Custom validation hooks
- Error handling

### Audit Logging
- State change tracking
- Transition history
- User attribution
- Timestamp recording
- Reason capture
- Evidence preservation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] State machine implemented
- [ ] All valid transitions defined
- [ ] Transition validation working
- [ ] Audit logging functional
- [ ] State persistence operational
- [ ] Rollback capabilities implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests successful

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- State transition tests
- Validation logic tests
- Audit logging tests
- Rollback tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end lifecycle tests
- Multi-user state change tests
- Database persistence tests

## Dependencies
- POA&M data model (6.1.1)
- Audit logging system
- User management system
- Database persistence layer

## Estimated Effort
**3-4 hours**

## Implementation Notes
- Design for extensibility
- Implement comprehensive audit trails
- Support custom transition conditions
- Provide clear error messages
- Ensure data consistency
