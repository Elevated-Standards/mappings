# 6.1.5: Implement Data Integrity Checks

## Overview
Build comprehensive data integrity validation including referential integrity, constraint validation, and consistency checks.

## Technical Requirements
- Referential integrity validation
- Constraint checking
- Consistency validation
- Data quality assessment
- Automated repair capabilities
- Integrity monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Referential Integrity
- Foreign key validation
- Orphaned record detection
- Cascade validation

- Cross-table consistency
- Relationship validation

### Constraint Validation
- Data type constraints
- Range validation
- Format validation
- Uniqueness constraints
- Required field validation
- Custom constraint rules

### Consistency Checks
- Cross-field consistency
- Temporal consistency
- Business rule consistency
- State consistency
- Aggregate consistency
- Version consistency

### Data Quality Assessment
- Completeness scoring
- Accuracy measurement
- Consistency rating
- Timeliness evaluation
- Validity assessment
- Quality reporting
