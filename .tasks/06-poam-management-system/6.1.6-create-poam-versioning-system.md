# 6.1.6: Create POA&M Versioning System

## Overview
Implement version control system for POA&M items with change tracking, rollback capabilities, and version comparison.

## Technical Requirements
- Version tracking system
- Change detection and logging
- Rollback capabilities
- Version comparison tools
- Branch and merge support
- Version metadata management

## Implementation Details

### Version Model
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PoamVersion {
    pub version_id: Uuid,
    pub poam_id: Uuid,
    pub version_number: u32,
    pub parent_version: Option<Uuid>,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub created_by: Uuid,
    pub change_summary: String,
    pub change_type: ChangeType,
    pub data_snapshot: PoamItem,
    pub metadata: VersionMetadata,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ChangeType {
    Create,
    Update,
    Delete,
    Restore,
    Merge,
}
```

### Change Tracking
- Automatic version creation
- Field-level change detection
- Change attribution
- Change categorization
- Diff generation
- Change impact analysis

### Rollback System
- Point-in-time restoration
- Selective field rollback
- Conflict resolution
- Rollback validation
- Audit trail preservation
- Recovery verification

### Version Comparison
- Side-by-side comparison
- Diff visualization
- Change highlighting
- Merge conflict detection
- Version timeline
- Impact analysis

### Branch Management
- Version branching
- Parallel development
- Merge operations
- Conflict resolution
- Branch policies
- Access control

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Version tracking system implemented
- [ ] Change detection working
- [ ] Rollback capabilities functional
- [ ] Version comparison tools operational
- [ ] Branch management supported
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests successful

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Version creation tests
