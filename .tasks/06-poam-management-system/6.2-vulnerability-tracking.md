# 6.2: Vulnerability Tracking

## Overview
Build comprehensive vulnerability discovery, intake, severity assessment, and control relationship mapping system. This component handles the complete vulnerability lifecycle from discovery through remediation tracking.

## Technical Requirements
- Vulnerability discovery and intake workflows
- Severity assessment and scoring algorithms
- Control relationship mapping
- Impact analysis capabilities
- Deduplication and correlation engine
- Integration with vulnerability scanners

## Implementation Details

### Intake Workflows
- Automated vulnerability import from scanners
- Manual vulnerability entry interface
- Bulk import capabilities
- Data validation and normalization
- Source tracking and attribution

### Severity Scoring
- CVSS v3.1 implementation
- Custom scoring algorithms
- Environmental scoring adjustments
- Temporal scoring updates
- Risk-based severity calculation

### Control Mapping
- Map vulnerabilities to affected controls
- Assess control effectiveness impact
- Track control implementation status
- Generate control gap analysis
- Support multiple framework mappings

### Impact Analysis
- Business impact assessment
- Technical impact evaluation
- Compliance impact analysis
- Risk propagation modeling
- Cost-benefit analysis for remediation

### Deduplication Engine
- Intelligent duplicate detection
- Cross-scanner correlation
- Merge duplicate entries
- Maintain source attribution
- Handle partial duplicates
