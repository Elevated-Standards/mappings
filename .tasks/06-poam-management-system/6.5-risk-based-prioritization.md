# 6.5: Risk-Based Prioritization

## Overview
Build risk-based POA&M prioritization system with business impact consideration, resource constraint optimization, and dynamic priority adjustment. This component ensures that remediation efforts focus on the highest-risk vulnerabilities first.

## Technical Requirements
- Risk-based prioritization algorithms
- Business impact assessment framework
- Resource constraint optimization
- Dynamic priority adjustment
- Priority conflict resolution
- Prioritization reporting and analytics

## Implementation Details

### Risk Prioritization
- Multi-factor risk scoring
- Threat likelihood assessment
- Impact severity evaluation
- Exploitability analysis
- Asset criticality weighting
- Environmental factor consideration

### Business Impact Assessment
- Financial impact modeling
- Operational disruption analysis
- Reputational risk evaluation
- Compliance impact assessment
- Customer impact analysis
- Strategic objective alignment

### Resource Optimization
- Resource capacity modeling
- Skill requirement matching
- Cost-benefit optimization
- Timeline constraint consideration
- Budget allocation optimization
- ROI maximization algorithms

### Dynamic Adjustment
- Real-time threat intelligence integration
- Changing business priority adaptation
- Resource availability updates
- New vulnerability incorporation
- Continuous reprioritization
- Stakeholder feedback integration

### Conflict Resolution
- Priority conflict detection
- Stakeholder input collection
- Automated decision support
- Manual override capabilities
- Consensus building tools
- Escalation procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Risk-based prioritization algorithms implemented
- [ ] Business impact assessment framework operational
- [ ] Resource constraint optimization working
- [ ] Dynamic priority adjustment functional
- [ ] Priority conflict resolution system deployed
- [ ] Prioritization reporting implemented
- [ ] Integration with risk assessment platform
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Prioritization algorithm tests
- Impact assessment calculation tests
- Optimization algorithm tests
- Conflict resolution logic tests
- Dynamic adjustment tests

### Integration Tests
- Risk platform integration tests
- Business system integration tests
- Real-time update tests
- Multi-stakeholder workflow tests

### Validation Tests
- Prioritization accuracy validation
- Business impact correlation tests
- Resource optimization effectiveness
- Stakeholder satisfaction testing

## Dependencies
- Risk Assessment Platform
- Vulnerability Tracking (6.2)
- Business impact data sources
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Stakeholder management system

## Estimated Effort
**3-4 days** (24-32 hours)

## Priority
**Medium** - Important for optimization but not blocking

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with existing risk assessment tools
- Support configurable prioritization weights
- Provide transparent decision rationale
- Enable stakeholder collaboration
- Design for organizational scalability
