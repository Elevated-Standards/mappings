# 7.1.4: Add Template Versioning System

## Overview
Implement version control for templates with change tracking, rollback capabilities, and migration support between template versions. Provide comprehensive template lifecycle management.

## Technical Requirements
- Template version control
- Change tracking and audit trails
- Migration support between versions
- Rollback capabilities
- Compatibility matrix maintenance
- Update notification system

## Implementation Details

### Version Control System
```rust
pub struct TemplateVersionControl {
    pub template_id: Uuid,
    pub versions: Vec<TemplateVersion>,
    pub current_version: String,
    pub change_log: Vec<ChangeLogEntry>,
    pub migration_rules: Vec<MigrationRule>,
}

pub struct TemplateVersion {
    pub version: String,
    pub template: Template,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub created_by: String,
    pub change_summary: String,
    pub compatibility: CompatibilityInfo,
}
```

### Change Tracking
- Detailed change logging
- Author attribution
- Timestamp recording
- Change categorization
- Impact assessment
- Approval tracking

### Migration Framework
- Version migration rules
- Automatic migration support
- Manual migration assistance
- Data preservation
- Validation during migration
- Rollback support

### Rollback Capabilities
- Version rollback functionality
- Impact assessment before rollback
- Data preservation during rollback
- Notification system
- Approval requirements
- Audit trail maintenance

### Compatibility Management
- Version compatibility matrix
- Dependency tracking
- Breaking change identification
- Upgrade path planning
- Deprecation management
- Support lifecycle

### Notification System
- Update notifications
- Breaking change alerts
- Deprecation warnings
- Migration reminders
- Rollback notifications
- Status updates
