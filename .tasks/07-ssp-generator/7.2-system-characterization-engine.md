# 7.2: System Characterization Engine

## Overview
Develop automated system description generation with component inventory integration, system boundary definition, and architecture diagram generation. This component automatically characterizes systems by analyzing inventory data and generating comprehensive system documentation including boundaries, architecture, and data flows.

## Technical Requirements
- Automated system description generation
- Component inventory integration
- System boundary definition
- Architecture diagram generation
- FIPS 199 system categorization automation
- Data flow documentation
- Network topology analysis

## Implementation Details

### System Description Generation
- Automated narrative generation from inventory data
- System purpose and functionality documentation
- Operational context analysis
- Service description automation
- User base characterization
- Mission impact assessment

### Inventory Integration
- Integration with inventory_mappings.json
- Component data extraction and analysis
- Configuration analysis
- Relationship mapping
- Dependency identification
- Asset categorization

### Boundary Definition
- Authorization boundary identification
- Security perimeter definition
- Network boundary analysis
- Data boundary classification
- Physical boundary documentation
- Logical boundary mapping

### Architecture Documentation
- Network diagram generation
- Data flow diagram creation
- Component relationship diagrams
- Service architecture visualization
- Security architecture mapping
- Integration point documentation

### Categorization Automation
- FIPS 199 impact level analysis
- Confidentiality impact assessment
- Integrity impact assessment
- Availability impact assessment
- Overall system categorization
- Categorization rationale generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Inventory system integration tests
- Risk assessment platform integration
- Multi-system processing tests

### Quality Tests
- Generated content accuracy validation
- Diagram quality and completeness
- Boundary definition correctness
- Categorization accuracy verification

## Dependencies
- Inventory data (inventory_mappings.json)
- Risk Assessment Platform
- Diagram generation libraries
- Network topology data
- Asset management system

## Estimated Effort
**4-5 days** (32-40 hours)

## Priority
**High** - Critical for automated SSP generation

## Implementation Notes
