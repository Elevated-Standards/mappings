# 7.2.1: Implement System Description Generation

## Overview
Create automated system description generator that produces comprehensive system overviews from inventory data. Include purpose, functionality, and operational context for complete system characterization.

## Technical Requirements
- Automated narrative generation
- System purpose documentation
- Functionality description
- Operational context analysis
- User base characterization
- Mission impact assessment

## Implementation Details

### System Description Generator
```rust
pub struct SystemDescriptionGenerator {
    pub inventory_analyzer: InventoryAnalyzer,
    pub narrative_engine: NarrativeEngine,
    pub context_analyzer: ContextAnalyzer,
    pub templates: Vec<DescriptionTemplate>,
}

pub struct SystemDescription {
    pub purpose: String,
    pub functionality: Vec<FunctionDescription>,
    pub operational_context: OperationalContext,
    pub user_base: UserBaseDescription,
    pub mission_impact: MissionImpact,
    pub technical_overview: TechnicalOverview,
}
```

### Narrative Generation Engine
- Template-based content generation
- Dynamic content assembly
- Context-aware narrative creation
- Technical detail integration
- Stakeholder-specific descriptions
- Multi-audience support

### Purpose Analysis
- Mission alignment assessment
- Business objective identification
- Functional requirement analysis
- Service delivery description
- Value proposition documentation
- Strategic importance evaluation

### Functionality Documentation
- Core function identification
- Service capability description
- Feature enumeration
- Process workflow documentation
- Integration point description
- Performance characteristics

### Operational Context
- Environment description
- Deployment model analysis
- Usage pattern identification
- Operational procedures
- Maintenance requirements
- Support structure

### User Base Characterization
- User type identification
- Access pattern analysis
- Usage volume assessment
- Geographic distribution
- Privilege level analysis
- Interaction model description

### Mission Impact Assessment
- Criticality analysis
- Business impact evaluation
- Service dependency mapping
- Availability requirements
- Performance impact assessment
- Risk tolerance evaluation
