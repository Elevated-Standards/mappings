# 7.2.3: Create System Boundary Definition Logic

## Overview
Implement logic to automatically define system boundaries based on component relationships, data flows, and security perimeters. Include authorization boundary documentation for comprehensive boundary management.

## Technical Requirements
- Authorization boundary identification
- Security perimeter definition
- Network boundary analysis
- Data boundary classification
- Physical boundary documentation
- Logical boundary mapping

## Implementation Details

### Boundary Definition Engine
```rust
pub struct BoundaryDefinitionEngine {
    pub boundary_analyzer: BoundaryAnalyzer,
    pub perimeter_detector: PerimeterDetector,
    pub relationship_mapper: RelationshipMapper,
    pub classification_engine: ClassificationEngine,
}

pub struct SystemBoundary {
    pub authorization_boundary: AuthorizationBoundary,
    pub network_boundaries: Vec<NetworkBoundary>,
    pub data_boundaries: Vec<DataBoundary>,
    pub physical_boundaries: Vec<PhysicalBoundary>,
    pub logical_boundaries: Vec<LogicalBoundary>,
}
```
