# 7.2.5: Add System Categorization Automation

## Overview
Implement FIPS 199 system categorization automation based on data types, system functions, and impact levels. Include confidentiality, integrity, and availability analysis with automated categorization logic.

## Technical Requirements
- FIPS 199 categorization automation
- Impact level analysis
- Confidentiality assessment
- Integrity evaluation
- Availability analysis
- Categorization rationale generation

## Implementation Details

### Categorization Engine
```rust
pub struct SystemCategorizationEngine {
    pub impact_analyzer: ImpactAnalyzer,
    pub data_classifier: DataClassifier,
    pub function_analyzer: FunctionAnalyzer,
    pub categorization_rules: Vec<CategorizationRule>,
}

pub struct SystemCategorization {
    pub confidentiality_impact: ImpactLevel,
    pub integrity_impact: ImpactLevel,
    pub availability_impact: ImpactLevel,
    pub overall_categorization: SystemCategory,
    pub rationale: CategorizationRationale,
}
```

### Impact Level Analysis

- Disclosure risk assessment
- Access control requirements
- Information sensitivity levels
- Confidentiality controls mapping

### Integrity Evaluation
- Data integrity requirements
- System reliability needs
- Accuracy requirements
- Authenticity verification
- Non-repudiation needs
- Integrity control mapping

### Availability Analysis
- Uptime requirements
- Performance expectations
- Recovery time objectives
- Business continuity needs
- Service level agreements
- Availability control mapping

### Automated Categorization Logic
- Rule-based categorization
- Machine learning enhancement
- Historical data analysis
- Peer system comparison
- Industry benchmark analysis
- Expert system integration

### Rationale Generation
- Decision explanation
- Supporting evidence compilation
- Risk factor identification
- Mitigation strategy documentation
- Compliance requirement mapping
- Stakeholder communication
