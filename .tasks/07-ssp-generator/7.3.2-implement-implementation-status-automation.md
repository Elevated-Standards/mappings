# 7.3.2: Implement Implementation Status Automation

## Overview
Create system to automatically track and document control implementation status based on configuration data and evidence. Include implemented, partially implemented, and planned states with automated assessment capabilities.

## Technical Requirements
- Automated status determination
- Configuration-based assessment
- Evidence-driven status updates
- Implementation percentage tracking
- Gap identification
- Status change tracking

## Implementation Details

### Implementation Status Engine
```rust
pub struct ImplementationStatusEngine {
    pub status_analyzer: StatusAnalyzer,
    pub evidence_processor: EvidenceProcessor,
    pub configuration_analyzer: ConfigurationAnalyzer,
    pub gap_detector: GapDetector,
}

pub struct ImplementationStatus {
    pub control_id: String,
    pub status: StatusLevel,
    pub implementation_percentage: f64,
    pub evidence: Vec<Evidence>,
    pub gaps: Vec<Gap>,
    pub last_assessed: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub enum StatusLevel {
    Implemented,
    PartiallyImplemented,
    Planned,
    NotImplemented,
    NotApplicable,
}
```

### Automated Status Assessment
- Configuration analysis
- Evidence evaluation
- Control testing results
- Compliance verification
- Performance metrics analysis
- Continuous monitoring integration

### Evidence Processing
- Evidence collection automation
- Evidence validation
- Evidence correlation
- Evidence quality assessment
- Evidence gap identification
- Evidence lifecycle management

### Configuration Analysis
- System configuration review
- Security setting verification
- Policy implementation checking
- Procedure validation
- Technical control verification
- Administrative control assessment

### Gap Detection
- Implementation gap identification
- Evidence gap analysis
- Control effectiveness gaps
- Compliance gap assessment
- Risk gap evaluation
- Remediation gap planning

### Status Tracking
- Status change monitoring
- Historical status tracking
- Trend analysis
- Performance metrics
- Compliance trending
- Improvement tracking

### Percentage Calculation
- Implementation completeness scoring
- Weighted assessment
- Multi-factor evaluation
- Quality-adjusted scoring
- Risk-weighted assessment
- Stakeholder-specific views
