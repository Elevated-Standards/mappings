# 7.3.3: Build Responsibility Matrix Generation

## Overview
Develop automated RACI matrix generation showing customer vs. provider responsibilities for each control. Support inherited, hybrid, and customer-responsible controls with comprehensive responsibility documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- RACI matrix generation
- Customer vs. provider responsibilities
- Inherited control identification
- Hybrid control documentation
- Shared responsibility mapping
- Responsibility change tracking

## Implementation Details

### Responsibility Matrix Engine
```rust
pub struct ResponsibilityMatrixEngine {
    pub matrix_generator: MatrixGenerator,
    pub responsibility_analyzer: ResponsibilityAnalyzer,
    pub inheritance_tracker: InheritanceTracker,
    pub documentation_generator: DocumentationGenerator,
}

pub struct ResponsibilityMatrix {
    pub control_id: String,
    pub responsibilities: HashMap<String, ResponsibilityLevel>,
    pub inheritance_type: InheritanceType,
    pub shared_elements: Vec<SharedElement>,
    pub documentation: ResponsibilityDocumentation,
}

pub enum ResponsibilityLevel {
    Responsible,
    Accountable,
    Consulted,
    Informed,
    NotApplicable,
}

pub enum InheritanceType {
    Inherited,
    Hybrid,
    CustomerResponsible,
    SharedResponsibility,
}
```

### RACI Matrix Generation
- Responsibility assignment automation
- Role-based responsibility mapping
- Control-specific RACI creation
- Multi-stakeholder matrices
- Hierarchical responsibility views
- Customizable matrix formats

### Customer vs. Provider Analysis
- Responsibility boundary identification
- Service model impact analysis
- Deployment model considerations
- Contractual responsibility mapping
- SLA responsibility alignment
- Liability assignment

### Inherited Control Handling
- Inheritance source identification
- Inherited responsibility documentation
- Inheritance validation
- Inheritance gap analysis
- Inheritance change tracking
- Inheritance compliance verification

### Hybrid Control Management
- Shared responsibility identification
- Responsibility split documentation
- Interface point definition
- Coordination requirement documentation
- Hybrid control validation
- Performance measurement

### Shared Responsibility Mapping
- Multi-party responsibility tracking
- Coordination mechanism documentation
- Communication requirement definition
- Escalation procedure mapping
- Performance monitoring
- Accountability framework

### Change Tracking
- Responsibility change monitoring
- Impact assessment
- Approval workflow integration
- Notification management
- Audit trail maintenance
- Version control

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Change tracking working
- [ ] Accuracy benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation quality verified

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
