# 7.3.5: Create Control Enhancement Handling

## Overview
Build system to handle control enhancements and their implementation documentation. Support enhancement selection based on impact level and organizational requirements with comprehensive enhancement management.

## Technical Requirements
- Enhancement selection logic
- Impact level-based recommendations
- Organizational requirement mapping
- Enhancement implementation tracking
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk-based prioritization

## Implementation Details

### Enhancement Management System
```rust
pub struct EnhancementManager {
    pub selection_engine: SelectionEngine,
    pub recommendation_system: RecommendationSystem,
    pub implementation_tracker: ImplementationTracker,
    pub cost_analyzer: CostAnalyzer,
}

pub struct ControlEnhancement {
    pub enhancement_id: String,
    pub base_control_id: String,
    pub enhancement_number: u32,
    pub description: String,
    pub impact_levels: Vec<ImpactLevel>,
    pub implementation_status: ImplementationStatus,
    pub cost_benefit: CostBenefitAnalysis,
}
```

### Selection Logic Engine
- Impact level analysis
- Risk assessment integration
- Organizational requirement matching
- Regulatory requirement mapping
- Industry best practice alignment
- Cost-effectiveness evaluation

### Recommendation System
- Automated enhancement recommendations
- Risk-based prioritization
- Compliance-driven selection
- Performance impact analysis
- Resource requirement assessment
- Implementation timeline estimation

### Implementation Tracking
- Enhancement implementation status
- Progress monitoring
- Milestone tracking
- Resource utilization
- Performance metrics
- Effectiveness measurement

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Implementation cost estimation
- Benefit quantification
- ROI calculation
- Risk reduction value
- Compliance value assessment
- Total cost of ownership

### Risk-Based Prioritization
- Risk reduction potential
- Threat mitigation value
- Vulnerability coverage
- Impact reduction assessment
- Likelihood reduction analysis
- Overall risk score improvement

### Organizational Mapping
- Policy requirement alignment
- Strategic objective mapping
- Compliance obligation matching
- Resource constraint consideration
- Timeline requirement alignment
- Stakeholder priority integration
