# 7.3.6: Implement Control Testing Procedures

## Overview
Create automated generation of control testing procedures and assessment methods. Include test frequency, methods, and expected outcomes for comprehensive control testing documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- Assessment method generation
- Test frequency determination
- Expected outcome definition
- Testing tool recommendations
- Evidence collection guidance
- Continuous monitoring integration

## Implementation Details

### Testing Procedure Generator
```rust
pub struct TestingProcedureGenerator {
    pub method_generator: MethodGenerator,
    pub frequency_calculator: FrequencyCalculator,
    pub outcome_predictor: OutcomePredictor,
    pub tool_recommender: ToolRecommender,
}

pub struct TestingProcedure {
    pub control_id: String,
    pub assessment_methods: Vec<AssessmentMethod>,
    pub test_frequency: TestFrequency,
    pub expected_outcomes: Vec<ExpectedOutcome>,
    pub testing_tools: Vec<TestingTool>,
    pub evidence_requirements: Vec<EvidenceRequirement>,
}

pub enum AssessmentMethod {
    Examine,
    Interview,
    Test,
    Automated,
    Continuous,
}
```

### Assessment Method Generation
