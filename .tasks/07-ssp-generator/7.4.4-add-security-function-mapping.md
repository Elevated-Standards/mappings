# 7.4.4: Add Security Function Mapping

## Overview
Implement mapping of components to security functions they provide. Include authentication, authorization, encryption, logging, and monitoring functions for comprehensive security function documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- Authentication function identification
- Authorization mechanism mapping
- Encryption service documentation
- Logging and monitoring functions
- Audit trail capabilities
- Security control implementation

## Implementation Details

### Security Function Mapper
```rust
pub struct SecurityFunctionMapper {
    pub function_analyzer: FunctionAnalyzer,
    pub control_mapper: ControlMapper,
    pub capability_assessor: CapabilityAssessor,
    pub documentation_generator: DocumentationGenerator,
}

pub struct SecurityFunction {
    pub function_id: String,
    pub function_type: SecurityFunctionType,
    pub component_id: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub capabilities: Vec<SecurityCapability>,
    pub controls_implemented: Vec<String>,
    pub performance_metrics: PerformanceMetrics,
}

pub enum SecurityFunctionType {
    Authentication,
    Authorization,
    Encryption,
    Logging,
    Monitoring,
    AuditTrail,
    AccessControl,
    DataProtection,
}
```

### Authentication Function Mapping
- Authentication mechanism identification
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Single sign-on capabilities
- Identity provider integration
- Authentication protocol analysis
- Credential management

### Authorization Mechanism Analysis
- Role-based access control
- Attribute-based access control
- Policy-based authorization
- Permission management
- Privilege escalation controls
- Access decision points

### Encryption Service Documentation

- Key management functions
- Cryptographic algorithm usage
- Certificate management
- Hardware security modules

### Logging and Monitoring Functions
