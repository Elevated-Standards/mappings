# 7.4.5: Implement Component Relationship Mapping

## Overview
Create system to map and document relationships between components including dependencies, data flows, and communication patterns for comprehensive relationship analysis.

## Technical Requirements
- Component dependency analysis
- Data flow relationship mapping
- Communication pattern documentation
- Integration point identification
- Service mesh documentation
- Microservice architecture mapping

## Implementation Details

### Relationship Mapping Engine
```rust
pub struct RelationshipMappingEngine {
    pub dependency_analyzer: DependencyAnalyzer,
    pub flow_mapper: FlowMapper,
    pub communication_analyzer: CommunicationAnalyzer,
    pub integration_detector: IntegrationDetector,
}

pub struct ComponentRelationship {
    pub relationship_id: String,
    pub source_component: String,
    pub target_component: String,
    pub relationship_type: RelationshipType,
    pub description: String,
    pub characteristics: RelationshipCharacteristics,
    pub performance_metrics: PerformanceMetrics,
}

pub enum RelationshipType {
    Dependency,
    DataFlow,
    Communication,
    Integration,
    Inheritance,
    Composition,
}
```
