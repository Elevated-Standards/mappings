# 7.5: Risk Assessment Integration

## Overview
Integrate FIPS 199 categorization, risk assessment summary generation, threat analysis documentation, and vulnerability assessment integration. This component connects the SSP generator with risk assessment platforms to automatically incorporate risk analysis results into system security plans.

## Technical Requirements
- FIPS 199 categorization integration
- Risk assessment summary generation
- Threat analysis documentation
- Vulnerability assessment integration
- Risk mitigation documentation
- Risk acceptance documentation
- Continuous risk monitoring support

## Implementation Details

### FIPS 199 Integration
- Categorization result import
- Impact level determination
- Confidentiality impact analysis
- Integrity impact analysis
- Availability impact analysis
- Overall system categorization
- Categorization rationale documentation

### Risk Assessment Summaries
- Risk identification compilation
- Likelihood assessment integration
- Impact analysis documentation
- Risk scoring aggregation
- Risk trend analysis
- Comparative risk assessment

### Threat Analysis Documentation
- Threat source identification
- Threat event documentation
- Threat scenario analysis
- Attack vector mapping
- Threat intelligence integration
- Threat landscape assessment

### Vulnerability Assessment Integration
- Vulnerability scan result import
- Severity rating analysis
- CVSS score integration
- Remediation plan linkage
- Vulnerability trend tracking
- False positive management

### Risk Mitigation Documentation
- Mitigation strategy documentation
- Control implementation mapping
- Residual risk calculation
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Implementation timeline tracking
- Effectiveness measurement

### Risk Acceptance Documentation
- Risk acceptance decisions
- Approval authority tracking
- Rationale documentation
- Monitoring requirements
- Review schedule management
- Acceptance criteria definition

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FIPS 199 categorization results integrated
- [ ] Risk assessment summaries generated automatically

- Risk assessment standard compliance
- Documentation completeness verification
- Data accuracy validation

## Dependencies
- Risk Assessment Platform
- Vulnerability scanning tools
- Threat intelligence feeds
- FIPS 199 categorization data
- Control implementation status

## Estimated Effort
**3-4 days** (24-32 hours)

## Priority
**Medium** - Important for comprehensive risk documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Support multiple risk assessment methodologies
- Implement real-time risk data integration
- Ensure data accuracy and consistency
- Design for multiple vulnerability scanners
- Integrate with threat intelligence platforms
- Maintain risk assessment audit trails
