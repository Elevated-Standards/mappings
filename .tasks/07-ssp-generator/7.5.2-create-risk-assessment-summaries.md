# 7.5.2: Create Risk Assessment Summaries

## Overview
Implement automated risk assessment summary generation including identified risks, likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies for comprehensive risk documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- Risk identification compilation
- Likelihood assessment integration
- Impact analysis documentation
- Risk scoring aggregation
- Risk trend analysis
- Comparative risk assessment

## Implementation Details

### Risk Summary Generator
```rust
pub struct RiskSummaryGenerator {
    pub risk_aggregator: RiskAggregator,
    pub likelihood_analyzer: LikelihoodAnalyzer,
    pub impact_assessor: ImpactAssessor,
    pub trend_analyzer: TrendAnalyzer,
}

pub struct RiskAssessmentSummary {
    pub assessment_id: String,
    pub system_id: String,
    pub identified_risks: Vec<IdentifiedRisk>,
    pub overall_risk_score: f64,
    pub risk_trends: Vec<RiskTrend>,
    pub mitigation_summary: MitigationSummary,
    pub assessment_date: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub struct IdentifiedRisk {
    pub risk_id: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub likelihood: LikelihoodLevel,
    pub impact: ImpactLevel,
    pub risk_score: f64,
    pub mitigation_status: MitigationStatus,
}
```

### Risk Identification Compilation
