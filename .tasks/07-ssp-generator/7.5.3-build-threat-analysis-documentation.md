# 7.5.3: Build Threat Analysis Documentation

## Overview
Create automated threat analysis documentation including threat sources, threat events, and threat scenarios relevant to the system for comprehensive threat assessment.

## Technical Requirements
- Threat source identification
- Threat event documentation
- Threat scenario analysis
- Attack vector mapping
- Threat intelligence integration
- Threat landscape assessment

## Implementation Details

### Threat Analysis Engine
```rust
pub struct ThreatAnalysisEngine {
    pub threat_identifier: ThreatIdentifier,
    pub scenario_analyzer: ScenarioAnalyzer,
    pub intelligence_integrator: IntelligenceIntegrator,
    pub documentation_generator: DocumentationGenerator,
}

pub struct ThreatAnalysis {
    pub analysis_id: String,
    pub system_id: String,
    pub threat_sources: Vec<ThreatSource>,
    pub threat_events: Vec<ThreatEvent>,
    pub threat_scenarios: Vec<ThreatScenario>,
    pub attack_vectors: Vec<AttackVector>,
    pub mitigation_strategies: Vec<MitigationStrategy>,
}
```

### Threat Source Identification
- Internal threat sources
- External threat sources
- Environmental threats
- Human threats
- Technical threats
- Natural disasters

### Threat Event Documentation
- Event categorization
- Event likelihood assessment
- Event impact analysis
- Event triggers
- Event indicators
- Event response procedures

### Threat Scenario Analysis
- Scenario development
- Attack path analysis
- Multi-stage attacks
- Scenario probability
- Impact assessment
- Mitigation effectiveness

### Attack Vector Mapping
- Entry point identification
- Attack surface analysis
- Vulnerability exploitation
- Lateral movement paths
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration routes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Threat source identification working
- [ ] Threat event documentation functional
- [ ] Threat scenario analysis operational
- [ ] Attack vector mapping complete
- [ ] Threat intelligence integration implemented
- [ ] Documentation quality verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Threat identification tests
- Scenario analysis tests
- Documentation generation tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end threat analysis
- Intelligence integration tests
