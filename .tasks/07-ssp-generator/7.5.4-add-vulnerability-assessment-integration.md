# 7.5.4: Add Vulnerability Assessment Integration

## Overview
Integrate vulnerability assessment results into SSP documentation including identified vulnerabilities, severity ratings, and remediation plans for comprehensive vulnerability management.

## Technical Requirements
- Vulnerability scan result import
- Severity rating analysis
- CVSS score integration
- Remediation plan linkage
- Vulnerability trend tracking
- False positive management

## Implementation Details

### Vulnerability Integration Engine
```rust
pub struct VulnerabilityIntegrationEngine {
    pub scanner_connector: ScannerConnector,
    pub severity_analyzer: SeverityAnalyzer,
    pub remediation_planner: RemediationPlanner,
    pub trend_tracker: TrendTracker,
}

pub struct VulnerabilityAssessment {
    pub assessment_id: String,
    pub system_id: String,
    pub vulnerabilities: Vec<Vulnerability>,
    pub severity_summary: SeveritySummary,
    pub remediation_plans: Vec<RemediationPlan>,
    pub trend_analysis: TrendAnalysis,
}

pub struct Vulnerability {
    pub vulnerability_id: String,
    pub cve_id: Option<String>,
    pub description: String,
    pub severity: SeverityLevel,
    pub cvss_score: f64,
    pub affected_components: Vec<String>,
    pub remediation_status: RemediationStatus,
}
```

### Scanner Integration
- Multiple scanner support
- API connectivity
- Data normalization
- Result aggregation
- Deduplication logic
- Quality validation

### Severity Analysis
- CVSS score processing
- Risk rating calculation
- Business impact assessment
- Exploitability analysis
- Environmental scoring
- Temporal scoring

### Remediation Planning
- Remediation strategy development
- Priority assignment
- Resource requirement estimation
- Timeline planning
- Risk mitigation assessment
- Cost-benefit analysis

### Trend Tracking
- Vulnerability trend analysis
- Remediation progress tracking
- New vulnerability detection
- Risk exposure trends
- Compliance impact tracking
- Performance metrics
