- Control implementation mapping
- Residual risk calculation
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Implementation timeline tracking
- Effectiveness measurement

## Implementation Details

### Risk Mitigation Engine
```rust
pub struct RiskMitigationEngine {
    pub strategy_generator: StrategyGenerator,
    pub control_mapper: ControlMapper,
    pub residual_calculator: ResidualCalculator,
    pub effectiveness_tracker: EffectivenessTracker,
}

pub struct RiskMitigation {
    pub mitigation_id: String,
    pub risk_id: String,
    pub strategy: MitigationStrategy,
    pub controls: Vec<ControlImplementation>,
    pub residual_risk: ResidualRisk,
    pub cost_benefit: CostBenefitAnalysis,
    pub timeline: ImplementationTimeline,
}

pub struct MitigationStrategy {
    pub strategy_type: StrategyType,
    pub description: String,
    pub approach: MitigationApproach,
    pub effectiveness_rating: f64,
    pub implementation_complexity: ComplexityLevel,
}
```
