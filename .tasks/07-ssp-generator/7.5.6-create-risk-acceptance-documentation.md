# 7.5.6: Create Risk Acceptance Documentation

## Overview
Build system to document risk acceptance decisions including rationale, approval authority, and monitoring requirements for accepted risks with comprehensive acceptance management.

## Technical Requirements
- Risk acceptance decisions
- Approval authority tracking
- Rationale documentation
- Monitoring requirements
- Review schedule management
- Acceptance criteria definition

## Implementation Details

### Risk Acceptance Engine
```rust
pub struct RiskAcceptanceEngine {
    pub decision_tracker: DecisionTracker,
    pub approval_manager: ApprovalManager,
    pub monitoring_scheduler: MonitoringScheduler,
    pub documentation_generator: DocumentationGenerator,
}

pub struct RiskAcceptance {
    pub acceptance_id: String,
    pub risk_id: String,
    pub decision: AcceptanceDecision,
    pub rationale: AcceptanceRationale,
    pub approval_authority: ApprovalAuthority,
    pub monitoring_plan: MonitoringPlan,
    pub review_schedule: ReviewSchedule,
}

pub struct AcceptanceDecision {
    pub decision_type: DecisionType,
    pub decision_date: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub decision_maker: String,
    pub conditions: Vec<AcceptanceCondition>,
    pub expiration_date: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

### Decision Documentation
- Acceptance decision recording
- Decision criteria application
- Condition specification
- Limitation definition
- Expiration management
- Review triggers

### Approval Authority Management
- Authority identification
- Delegation tracking
- Approval workflow
- Signature requirements
- Accountability assignment
- Escalation procedures

### Rationale Documentation
- Business justification
- Technical rationale
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Alternative assessment
- Risk tolerance alignment
- Strategic considerations

### Monitoring Requirements
- Monitoring plan development
- Key indicator identification
- Threshold definition
- Alert configuration
- Reporting requirements
- Escalation procedures

### Review Schedule Management
- Review frequency determination
- Review criteria definition
- Stakeholder notification
- Review process automation
- Decision reassessment
- Update procedures

### Acceptance Criteria
- Risk threshold definition
- Acceptance conditions
- Performance requirements
- Compliance obligations
- Business constraints
- Technical limitations
