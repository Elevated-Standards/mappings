# 7.6: Compliance Mapping & Documentation

## Overview
Develop framework compliance documentation with control mapping tables, baseline adherence reporting, and gap analysis integration. This component creates comprehensive compliance documentation showing how systems meet requirements across multiple frameworks and standards.

## Technical Requirements
- Framework compliance documentation
- Control mapping tables
- Baseline adherence reporting
- Gap analysis integration
- Compliance matrix generation
- Framework crosswalk tables
- Multi-framework support

## Implementation Details

### Framework Compliance Documentation
- FedRAMP compliance documentation
- FISMA requirement mapping
- SOC 2 compliance reporting
- ISO 27001 standard mapping
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- Industry-specific compliance
- Custom framework support

### Control Mapping Tables
- Cross-framework control mapping
- Implementation approach documentation
- Control inheritance mapping
- Shared responsibility documentation
- Control family organization
- Mapping accuracy verification

### Baseline Adherence Reporting
- Low baseline compliance reporting
- Moderate baseline assessment
- High baseline verification
- Tailoring documentation
- Exception reporting
- Compliance percentage calculation

### Gap Analysis Integration
- Gap identification import
- Remediation plan integration
- Timeline documentation
- Priority assignment
- Resource requirement analysis
- Progress tracking

### Compliance Matrix Generation
- Multi-framework status matrix
- Implementation status tracking
- Evidence linkage
- Compliance scoring
- Trend analysis
- Executive reporting

### Framework Crosswalk Tables
- Equivalent control identification
- Mapping relationship documentation
- Standard comparison tables
- Compliance overlap analysis
- Unique requirement identification
- Framework selection guidance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework compliance documentation generated
- [ ] Control mapping tables created automatically
- [ ] Baseline adherence reporting functional
- [ ] Gap analysis results integrated
- [ ] Compliance matrix generation operational
- [ ] Framework crosswalk tables complete
- [ ] Multi-framework support verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (multiple frameworks processed <5 minutes)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Framework mapping tests
- Control relationship tests
- Baseline compliance tests
- Gap analysis integration tests
- Matrix generation tests

### Integration Tests
- Control mapping engine integration
- Gap analysis tool integration
- Multi-framework processing tests
- End-to-end compliance reporting

### Compliance Tests
- Framework accuracy validation
- Mapping correctness verification
- Baseline compliance verification
- Gap analysis accuracy testing

## Dependencies
- Control Mapping Engine
- Gap Analysis Tool
- Framework definition files
- Control implementation data
- Baseline requirement specifications

## Estimated Effort
**3-4 days** (24-32 hours)

## Priority
**Medium** - Important for multi-framework compliance

## Implementation Notes
- Support major compliance frameworks
- Implement accurate control mapping
- Ensure framework definition accuracy
- Design for framework extensibility
- Integrate with existing gap analysis
- Maintain mapping accuracy and updates
