# 7.6.1: Create Framework Compliance Documentation

## Overview
Build automated compliance documentation for multiple frameworks (FedRAMP, FISMA, SOC 2, ISO 27001) showing how system meets requirements for comprehensive compliance reporting.

## Technical Requirements
- FedRAMP compliance documentation
- FISMA requirement mapping
- SOC 2 compliance reporting
- ISO 27001 standard mapping
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- Industry-specific compliance

## Implementation Details

### Framework Compliance Engine
```rust
pub struct FrameworkComplianceEngine {
    pub framework_mapper: FrameworkMapper,
    pub compliance_analyzer: ComplianceAnalyzer,
    pub documentation_generator: DocumentationGenerator,
    pub gap_identifier: GapIdentifier,
}

pub struct ComplianceDocumentation {
    pub framework_id: String,
    pub framework_name: String,
    pub compliance_status: ComplianceStatus,
    pub requirements: Vec<RequirementCompliance>,
    pub gaps: Vec<ComplianceGap>,
    pub evidence: Vec<ComplianceEvidence>,
}

pub struct RequirementCompliance {
    pub requirement_id: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub compliance_level: ComplianceLevel,
    pub implementation_approach: String,
    pub evidence_references: Vec<String>,
}
```

### FedRAMP Compliance
- FedRAMP Rev 5 requirements
- Control implementation documentation
- Continuous monitoring compliance
- Authorization boundary compliance
- Security assessment compliance
- Incident response compliance

### FISMA Compliance
- FISMA requirement mapping
- Risk management framework
- Security categorization compliance
- Control selection compliance
- Assessment and authorization
- Continuous monitoring

### SOC 2 Compliance
- Trust service criteria mapping
- Control objective compliance
- Evidence collection
- Testing procedure documentation
- Exception reporting
- Management assertion

### ISO 27001 Compliance
- Information security management
- Risk management compliance
- Control objective mapping
- Implementation guidance
- Audit preparation
- Certification support

### NIST CSF Alignment
- Framework core mapping
- Implementation tier assessment
- Profile development
- Outcome measurement
- Continuous improvement
- Maturity assessment

### Gap Analysis
- Requirement gap identification
- Implementation gap analysis
- Evidence gap assessment
- Compliance gap prioritization
- Remediation planning
- Timeline estimation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FedRAMP compliance documentation working
- [ ] FISMA requirement mapping functional
- [ ] SOC 2 compliance reporting operational
- [ ] ISO 27001 mapping complete
- [ ] NIST CSF alignment implemented
- [ ] Gap analysis working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Framework mapping tests
- Compliance analysis tests
- Documentation generation tests
- Gap identification tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end compliance documentation
- Multi-framework analysis tests
- Complex requirement tests

## Dependencies
- Framework requirement definitions
- Control implementation data
- Evidence management systems
- Gap analysis tools
- Compliance monitoring platforms

## Estimated Effort
**8-10 hours**

## Implementation Notes
