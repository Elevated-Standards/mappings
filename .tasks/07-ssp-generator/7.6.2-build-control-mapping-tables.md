# 7.6.2: Build Control Mapping Tables

## Overview
Create automated control mapping tables showing relationships between different framework controls and implementation approaches for comprehensive control correlation.

## Technical Requirements
- Cross-framework control mapping
- Implementation approach documentation
- Control inheritance mapping
- Shared responsibility documentation
- Control family organization
- Mapping accuracy verification

## Implementation Details

### Control Mapping Engine
```rust
pub struct ControlMappingEngine {
    pub mapper: ControlMapper,
    pub relationship_analyzer: RelationshipAnalyzer,
    pub table_generator: TableGenerator,
    pub validator: MappingValidator,
}

pub struct ControlMappingTable {
    pub table_id: String,
    pub source_framework: String,
    pub target_frameworks: Vec<String>,
    pub mappings: Vec<ControlMapping>,
    pub metadata: MappingMetadata,
}

pub struct ControlMapping {
    pub source_control: String,
    pub target_controls: Vec<String>,
    pub mapping_type: MappingType,
    pub relationship_strength: f64,
    pub implementation_notes: String,
}
```

### Cross-Framework Mapping
- NIST 800-53 to FedRAMP mapping
- ISO 27001 to NIST mapping
- SOC 2 to NIST mapping
- Custom framework mapping
- Bidirectional mapping support
- Mapping confidence scoring

### Implementation Approach Documentation

- Inheritance source documentation
- Inheritance type classification
- Responsibility assignment
- Inheritance validation
- Change impact analysis

### Shared Responsibility Documentation
- Customer responsibilities
- Provider responsibilities
- Shared responsibilities
- Responsibility boundaries
- Interface definitions
- Coordination requirements

### Control Family Organization
- Family-based grouping
- Hierarchical organization
- Related control clustering
- Enhancement relationships
- Dependency mapping
- Implementation sequencing

### Mapping Validation
- Accuracy verification
- Completeness checking
