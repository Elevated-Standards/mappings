# 7.6.3: Implement Baseline Adherence Reporting

## Overview
Develop reporting system showing adherence to security baselines (Low, Moderate, High) with gap identification and remediation tracking for comprehensive baseline compliance.

## Technical Requirements
- Low baseline compliance reporting
- Moderate baseline assessment
- High baseline verification
- Tailoring documentation
- Exception reporting
- Compliance percentage calculation

## Implementation Details

### Baseline Adherence Engine
```rust
pub struct BaselineAdherenceEngine {
    pub baseline_analyzer: BaselineAnalyzer,
    pub compliance_calculator: ComplianceCalculator,
    pub gap_detector: GapDetector,
    pub report_generator: ReportGenerator,
}

pub struct BaselineAdherence {
    pub baseline_level: BaselineLevel,
    pub overall_compliance: f64,
    pub control_compliance: Vec<ControlCompliance>,
    pub gaps: Vec<BaselineGap>,
    pub tailoring_decisions: Vec<TailoringDecision>,
    pub exceptions: Vec<BaselineException>,
}

pub enum BaselineLevel {
    Low,
    Moderate,
    High,
    Custom,
}
```

### Low Baseline Assessment
- Low impact control verification
- Basic security requirement compliance
- Minimum control implementation
- Essential safeguard verification
- Fundamental protection assessment
- Entry-level compliance checking

### Moderate Baseline Assessment
- Moderate impact control verification
- Enhanced security requirement compliance
- Comprehensive control implementation
- Advanced safeguard verification
- Robust protection assessment
- Standard compliance checking

### High Baseline Assessment
- High impact control verification
- Stringent security requirement compliance
- Maximum control implementation
- Premium safeguard verification
- Maximum protection assessment
- Advanced compliance checking

### Tailoring Documentation
- Tailoring decision recording
- Justification documentation
- Impact assessment
- Alternative control identification
- Compensating control documentation
- Approval tracking

### Exception Reporting
- Exception identification
- Exception justification
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation planning
- Approval documentation
- Monitoring requirements

### Compliance Calculation
- Control compliance scoring
- Weighted compliance metrics
- Baseline adherence percentage
- Gap impact assessment
- Trend analysis
- Performance indicators

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Low baseline reporting working
- [ ] Moderate baseline assessment functional
- [ ] High baseline verification operational
- [ ] Tailoring documentation complete
- [ ] Exception reporting implemented
- [ ] Compliance calculation working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Baseline analysis tests
- Compliance calculation tests
- Gap detection tests
- Report generation tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end adherence reporting
- Multi-baseline analysis tests
- Complex tailoring tests

## Dependencies
- Security baseline definitions
- Control implementation data
- Tailoring guidance
- Exception management systems
- Compliance monitoring tools

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours**

## Implementation Notes
- Support all baseline levels
- Implement accurate compliance calculation
- Ensure comprehensive gap analysis
- Design for tailoring flexibility
- Maintain reporting accuracy
