# 7.6.4: Integrate Gap Analysis Results

## Overview
Build integration with Gap Analysis Tool to include identified gaps, remediation plans, and timeline information in SSP documentation for comprehensive gap management.

## Technical Requirements
- Gap identification import
- Remediation plan integration
- Timeline documentation
- Priority assignment
- Resource requirement analysis
- Progress tracking

## Implementation Details

### Gap Analysis Integration Engine
```rust
pub struct GapAnalysisIntegrationEngine {
    pub gap_importer: GapImporter,
    pub remediation_integrator: RemediationIntegrator,
    pub timeline_manager: TimelineManager,
    pub progress_tracker: ProgressTracker,
}

pub struct GapAnalysisResults {
    pub analysis_id: String,
    pub system_id: String,
    pub identified_gaps: Vec<IdentifiedGap>,
    pub remediation_plans: Vec<RemediationPlan>,
    pub implementation_timeline: Timeline,
    pub resource_requirements: ResourceRequirements,
}

pub struct IdentifiedGap {
    pub gap_id: String,
    pub gap_type: GapType,
    pub description: String,
    pub severity: SeverityLevel,
    pub affected_controls: Vec<String>,
    pub business_impact: BusinessImpact,
}
```
