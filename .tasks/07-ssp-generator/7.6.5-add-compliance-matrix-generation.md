# 7.6.5: Add Compliance Matrix Generation

## Overview
Create automated compliance matrix generation showing control implementation status across multiple frameworks and standards for comprehensive compliance visualization.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-framework status matrix
- Implementation status tracking
- Evidence linkage
- Compliance scoring
- Trend analysis
- Executive reporting

## Implementation Details

### Compliance Matrix Engine
```rust
pub struct ComplianceMatrixEngine {
    pub matrix_generator: MatrixGenerator,
    pub status_aggregator: StatusAggregator,
    pub scoring_calculator: ScoringCalculator,
    pub trend_analyzer: TrendAnalyzer,
}

pub struct ComplianceMatrix {
    pub matrix_id: String,
    pub frameworks: Vec<String>,
    pub controls: Vec<ControlStatus>,
    pub overall_scores: HashMap<String, f64>,
    pub trend_data: TrendData,
    pub last_updated: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub struct ControlStatus {
    pub control_id: String,
    pub framework_status: HashMap<String, ImplementationStatus>,
    pub evidence_count: u32,
    pub compliance_score: f64,
    pub last_assessed: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

### Multi-Framework Matrix
- Framework column generation
- Control row organization
- Status cell population
- Color coding implementation
- Legend generation
- Navigation support

### Implementation Status Tracking
- Status aggregation across frameworks
- Implementation percentage calculation
- Progress tracking
- Change detection
- Historical comparison
- Trend identification

### Evidence Linkage
- Evidence count display
- Evidence quality indicators
- Evidence gap identification
- Evidence freshness tracking
- Evidence validation status
- Evidence accessibility

### Compliance Scoring
- Framework-specific scoring
- Weighted scoring models
- Aggregate score calculation
- Benchmark comparison
- Target achievement tracking
- Performance indicators

### Trend Analysis
- Historical trend tracking
- Improvement identification
- Regression detection
- Seasonal patterns
- Predictive analysis
- Forecast generation

### Executive Reporting
- High-level summary views
- Key performance indicators
- Risk indicators
- Action item summaries
- Resource requirement summaries
- Strategic recommendations
