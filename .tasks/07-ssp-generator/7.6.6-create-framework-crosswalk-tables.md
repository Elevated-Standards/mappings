# 7.6.6: Create Framework Crosswalk Tables

## Overview
Build automated crosswalk tables showing equivalent controls across different frameworks and standards for compliance mapping and framework comparison.

## Technical Requirements
- Equivalent control identification
- Mapping relationship documentation
- Standard comparison tables
- Compliance overlap analysis
- Unique requirement identification
- Framework selection guidance

## Implementation Details

### Crosswalk Table Engine
```rust
pub struct CrosswalkTableEngine {
    pub equivalence_mapper: EquivalenceMapper,
    pub relationship_analyzer: RelationshipAnalyzer,
    pub table_generator: TableGenerator,
    pub guidance_generator: GuidanceGenerator,
}

pub struct CrosswalkTable {
    pub table_id: String,
    pub source_framework: String,
    pub target_framework: String,
    pub crosswalk_mappings: Vec<CrosswalkMapping>,
    pub coverage_analysis: CoverageAnalysis,
    pub guidance: SelectionGuidance,
}

pub struct CrosswalkMapping {
    pub source_control: String,
    pub target_controls: Vec<String>,
    pub equivalence_level: EquivalenceLevel,
    pub mapping_notes: String,
    pub implementation_differences: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Equivalent Control Identification
- Direct equivalence mapping
- Partial equivalence identification
- Functional equivalence analysis
- Conceptual similarity mapping
- Implementation approach comparison
- Objective alignment assessment

### Mapping Relationship Documentation
- One-to-one mappings
- One-to-many mappings
- Many-to-one mappings
- Many-to-many mappings
- No equivalent mappings
- Conditional mappings

### Standard Comparison Tables
- Side-by-side comparison
- Requirement text comparison
- Implementation guidance comparison
- Assessment procedure comparison
- Evidence requirement comparison
- Compliance criteria comparison

### Compliance Overlap Analysis
- Common requirement identification
- Unique requirement isolation
- Gap identification
- Redundancy analysis
- Efficiency opportunities
- Optimization recommendations

### Unique Requirement Identification
- Framework-specific requirements
- Additional obligations
- Enhanced requirements
- Specialized controls
- Industry-specific additions
- Regulatory variations

### Framework Selection Guidance
- Selection criteria development
- Decision matrix creation
- Pros and cons analysis
- Implementation complexity assessment
- Cost-benefit comparison
- Strategic alignment evaluation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Equivalent control identification working
- [ ] Mapping relationship documentation functional
- [ ] Standard comparison tables operational
- [ ] Compliance overlap analysis complete
- [ ] Unique requirement identification implemented
- [ ] Framework selection guidance working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Equivalence mapping tests
- Relationship analysis tests
- Table generation tests
- Guidance generation tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end crosswalk generation
- Multi-framework crosswalk tests
- Complex mapping tests

## Dependencies
- Framework control catalogs
- Mapping rule definitions
- Equivalence algorithms
- Comparison frameworks
- Selection criteria

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours**

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure accurate equivalence mapping
- Support multiple framework combinations
