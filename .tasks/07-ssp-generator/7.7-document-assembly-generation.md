# 7.7: Document Assembly & Generation

## Overview
Implement multi-format output (DOCX, PDF, OSCAL JSON) with template-based document assembly, content validation, and version control. This component combines all SSP components into cohesive documents with quality assurance and change management capabilities.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-format output (DOCX, PDF, OSCAL JSON)
- Template-based document assembly
- Content validation and quality checks
- Version control and change tracking
- Document certification support
- Performance optimization
- Batch processing capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Multi-Format Generation
- Microsoft Word (DOCX) generation
- PDF document creation
- OSCAL JSON export
- HTML output support
- Consistent formatting across formats
- Format-specific optimizations

### Template-Based Assembly
- Modular content assembly
- Section ordering management
- Cross-reference resolution
- Table of contents generation
- Index creation
- Appendix management

### Content Validation
- Completeness checking
- Accuracy verification
- Compliance validation
- Cross-reference validation
- Format consistency checking
- Quality scoring

### Quality Checks and Scoring
- Content quality assessment
- Completeness scoring
- Accuracy metrics
- Compliance rating
- Improvement recommendations
- Quality trend tracking

### Version Control
- Document versioning
- Change tracking
- Comparison capabilities
- Rollback functionality
- Branch management
- Merge conflict resolution

### Change Tracking
- Modification logging
- Author attribution
- Timestamp recording
- Change rationale capture
- Approval workflow integration
- Audit trail maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-format document generation working
- [ ] Template-based assembly engine functional
- [ ] Content validation system operational
- [ ] Quality checks and scoring implemented
- [ ] Version control system complete
- [ ] Change tracking system working

## Dependencies
- All SSP components (7.1-7.6)
- Document templates
- Format generation libraries
- Version control system
- Quality assessment framework

## Estimated Effort
**4-5 days** (32-40 hours)

## Priority
**High** - Final output generation component

## Implementation Notes
- Optimize for large document generation
- Ensure format consistency and quality
- Implement robust error handling
- Design for scalability and performance
- Support concurrent document generation
- Maintain high-quality output standards
