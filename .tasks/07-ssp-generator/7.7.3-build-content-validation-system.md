# 7.7.3: Build Content Validation System

## Overview
Implement content validation system to ensure generated SSPs meet completeness, accuracy, and compliance requirements before finalization for comprehensive quality assurance.

## Technical Requirements
- Completeness checking
- Accuracy verification
- Compliance validation
- Cross-reference validation
- Format consistency checking
- Quality scoring

## Implementation Details

### Content Validation Engine
```rust
pub struct ContentValidationEngine {
    pub completeness_checker: CompletenessChecker,
    pub accuracy_verifier: AccuracyVerifier,
    pub compliance_validator: ComplianceValidator,
    pub quality_scorer: QualityScorer,
}

pub struct ValidationResults {
    pub validation_id: String,
    pub document_id: String,
    pub overall_score: f64,
    pub completeness_score: f64,
    pub accuracy_score: f64,
    pub compliance_score: f64,
    pub issues: Vec<ValidationIssue>,
    pub recommendations: Vec<Recommendation>,
}

pub struct ValidationIssue {
    pub issue_id: String,
    pub severity: IssueSeverity,
    pub category: IssueCategory,
    pub description: String,
    pub location: DocumentLocation,
    pub suggested_fix: Option<String>,
}
```

### Completeness Checking
- Required section verification
- Mandatory content validation
- Field completeness assessment
- Template coverage analysis
- Content gap identification
- Missing element detection

### Accuracy Verification
- Data consistency checking
- Cross-reference validation
- Calculation verification
- Fact checking
- Source validation
- Technical accuracy assessment

### Compliance Validation
- FedRAMP compliance checking
- OSCAL schema validation
- Regulatory requirement verification
- Standard adherence checking
- Policy compliance validation
- Framework requirement verification

### Cross-Reference Validation
- Internal reference checking
- External reference validation
- Link integrity verification
- Reference consistency
- Citation validation
- Hyperlink verification

### Format Consistency Checking
- Style consistency validation
- Formatting standard compliance
- Template adherence checking
- Layout validation
- Typography consistency
- Brand compliance

### Quality Scoring
- Content quality assessment
- Readability analysis
- Professional presentation scoring
- Technical accuracy rating
- Compliance adherence scoring
- Overall quality metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Completeness checking working
- [ ] Accuracy verification functional
- [ ] Compliance validation operational
- [ ] Cross-reference validation complete
