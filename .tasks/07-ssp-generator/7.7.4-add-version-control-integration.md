# 7.7.4: Add Version Control Integration

## Overview
Integrate version control system for SSP documents including change tracking, approval workflows, and document history management for comprehensive document lifecycle management.

## Technical Requirements
- Document versioning
- Change tracking
- Approval workflow integration
- History management
- Branch management
- Merge conflict resolution

## Implementation Details

### Version Control Engine
```rust
pub struct VersionControlEngine {
    pub version_manager: VersionManager,
    pub change_tracker: ChangeTracker,
    pub workflow_manager: WorkflowManager,
    pub history_manager: HistoryManager,
}

pub struct DocumentVersion {
    pub version_id: String,
    pub document_id: String,
    pub version_number: String,
    pub created_by: String,
    pub created_date: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub changes: Vec<DocumentChange>,
    pub approval_status: ApprovalStatus,
    pub metadata: VersionMetadata,
}

pub struct DocumentChange {
    pub change_id: String,
    pub change_type: ChangeType,
    pub section: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

### Document Versioning

- Version tagging
- Release management
- Snapshot creation
- Version comparison

### Change Tracking
- Content change detection
- Granular change tracking
- Change attribution
- Change categorization
- Change impact analysis
- Change visualization

### Approval Workflow Integration
- Multi-stage approval process
- Role-based approval
- Approval delegation
- Approval notifications
- Approval tracking
- Rejection handling

### History Management
- Complete change history
- Version timeline
- Author tracking
- Change rationale
- Rollback capabilities
- Archive management

### Branch Management
