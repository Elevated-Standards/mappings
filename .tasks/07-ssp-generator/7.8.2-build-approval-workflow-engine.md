# 7.8.2: Build Approval Workflow Engine

## Overview
Develop approval workflow engine supporting multi-level approvals, conditional routing, and automated notifications for comprehensive approval process management.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-level approval support
- Conditional workflow routing
- Automated notification system
- Approval delegation
- Escalation procedures
- Audit trail maintenance

## Implementation Details

### Approval Workflow Engine
```rust
pub struct ApprovalWorkflowEngine {
    pub workflow_manager: WorkflowManager,
    pub routing_engine: RoutingEngine,
    pub notification_system: NotificationSystem,
    pub audit_tracker: AuditTracker,
}

pub struct ApprovalWorkflow {
    pub workflow_id: String,
    pub document_id: String,
    pub workflow_definition: WorkflowDefinition,
    pub current_stage: WorkflowStage,
    pub approvals: Vec<ApprovalRecord>,
    pub status: WorkflowStatus,
}

pub struct WorkflowDefinition {
    pub stages: Vec<ApprovalStage>,
    pub routing_rules: Vec<RoutingRule>,
    pub escalation_rules: Vec<EscalationRule>,
    pub notification_rules: Vec<NotificationRule>,
}
```

### Multi-Level Approval Support
- Sequential approval stages
- Parallel approval processing
- Conditional approval paths
- Stage dependencies
- Approval requirements
- Bypass mechanisms

### Conditional Workflow Routing
- Rule-based routing
- Dynamic path selection
- Condition evaluation
- Branch management
- Loop handling
- Exception routing

### Automated Notification System
- Stage transition notifications
- Approval request alerts
- Deadline reminders
- Escalation notifications
- Status updates
- Completion notifications

### Approval Delegation
- Delegation assignment
- Temporary delegation
- Authority transfer
- Delegation tracking
- Approval on behalf
- Delegation expiration

### Escalation Procedures
- Automatic escalation
- Time-based escalation
- Manual escalation
- Escalation chains
- Authority levels
- Resolution tracking

### Audit Trail Maintenance
- Complete workflow history
- Decision tracking
- Timing records
- Authority verification
- Change documentation
- Compliance evidence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-level approval support working
- [ ] Conditional workflow routing functional
- [ ] Automated notification system operational
- [ ] Approval delegation complete
- [ ] Escalation procedures implemented
- [ ] Audit trail maintenance working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
