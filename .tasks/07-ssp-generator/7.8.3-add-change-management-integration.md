## Overview
Integrate with change management systems to track document changes, impact assessment, and approval requirements for comprehensive change control.

## Technical Requirements
- Change request integration
- Impact assessment automation
- Approval requirement determination
- Change tracking
- Rollback capabilities
- Change documentation

## Implementation Details

### Change Management Engine
```rust
pub struct ChangeManagementEngine {
    pub change_tracker: ChangeTracker,
    pub impact_assessor: ImpactAssessor,
    pub approval_determiner: ApprovalDeterminer,
    pub rollback_manager: RollbackManager,
}

pub struct ChangeRequest {
    pub change_id: String,
    pub document_id: String,
    pub change_type: ChangeType,
    pub description: String,
    pub impact_assessment: ImpactAssessment,
    pub approval_requirements: ApprovalRequirements,
    pub status: ChangeStatus,
}

pub struct ImpactAssessment {
    pub affected_sections: Vec<String>,
    pub compliance_impact: ComplianceImpact,
    pub risk_impact: RiskImpact,
    pub stakeholder_impact: StakeholderImpact,
    pub timeline_impact: TimelineImpact,
}
```
