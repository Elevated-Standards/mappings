## Implementation Details

### Final Approval Engine
```rust
pub struct FinalApprovalEngine {
    pub signature_manager: SignatureManager,
    pub approval_validator: ApprovalValidator,
    pub publication_engine: PublicationEngine,
    pub distribution_manager: DistributionManager,
}

pub struct FinalApproval {
    pub approval_id: String,
    pub document_id: String,
    pub approver: String,
    pub approval_date: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub digital_signature: DigitalSignature,
    pub approval_conditions: Vec<ApprovalCondition>,
    pub publication_authorization: PublicationAuthorization,
}

pub struct PublicationPackage {
    pub package_id: String,
    pub document_versions: Vec<DocumentVersion>,
    pub distribution_list: Vec<Recipient>,
    pub publication_metadata: PublicationMetadata,
    pub compliance_verification: ComplianceVerification,
}
```
