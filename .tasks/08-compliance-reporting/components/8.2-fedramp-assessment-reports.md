# 8.2: FedRAMP Assessment Reports

## Overview
Implement FedRAMP SAR/SAP generation, continuous monitoring reports, and authorization package assembly. This component ensures full compliance with FedRAMP requirements for security assessment documentation and ongoing monitoring.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Security Assessment Report (SAR) automated generation
- Security Assessment Plan (SAP) template and automation
- Continuous monitoring report generation
- Authorization package assembly and validation
- FedRAMP artifact generation and management
- Assessment evidence collection and organization

### Compliance Requirements
- FedRAMP Rev 5 template compliance
- NIST SP 800-53 control mapping
- Required documentation sections and formatting
- Regulatory submission standards adherence
- Chain of custody for assessment evidence

### Architecture Requirements
- FedRAMP-specific template engine
- Assessment data aggregation pipeline
- Evidence collection and validation system
- Package assembly automation
- Compliance verification framework

## Implementation Details

### SAR Generation
- Automated control assessment result compilation
- Testing procedure documentation
- Finding and recommendation generation
