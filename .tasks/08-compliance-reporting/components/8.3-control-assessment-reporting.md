# 8.3: Control Assessment Reporting

## Overview
Build control-by-control assessment results, implementation evidence documentation, testing procedure results, and deficiency tracking. This component provides detailed assessment reporting for individual security controls with comprehensive evidence management.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Control-by-control assessment report generation
- Implementation evidence documentation and organization
- Testing procedure result tracking and validation
- Deficiency and recommendation management
- Control effectiveness scoring and metrics
- Assessment timeline tracking and monitoring

### Assessment Framework
- Standardized control assessment templates
- Evidence categorization and validation
- Testing procedure automation and tracking
- Deficiency workflow management
- Effectiveness scoring algorithms
- Timeline and milestone tracking

### Data Management
- Evidence artifact storage and retrieval
- Assessment result aggregation
- Historical tracking and trending
- Cross-reference and dependency mapping
- Audit trail maintenance

## Implementation Details

### Control Assessment Templates
- Standardized report structure for each control
- Control description and implementation details
- Testing procedures and methodologies
- Assessment results and findings
- Evidence references and attachments

### Evidence Documentation System
- Artifact collection and categorization
- Screenshot and configuration management
- Document version control
- Evidence validation and verification
- Cross-referencing and linking

### Testing Procedure Tracking
- Test execution status monitoring
- Finding documentation and classification
- Evidence collection automation
- Result validation and approval
- Remediation tracking

### Deficiency Management
- Deficiency identification and classification
- Recommendation generation and assignment
- Remediation timeline tracking
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Closure verification and validation
