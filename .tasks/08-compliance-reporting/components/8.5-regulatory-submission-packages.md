# 8.5: Regulatory Submission Packages

## Overview
Build FedRAMP submission packages, NIST framework compliance reports, custom regulatory reports with validation. This component ensures complete and accurate regulatory submission packages that meet all requirements for various compliance frameworks.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- FedRAMP submission package template creation and assembly
- NIST framework compliance report generation
- Custom regulatory report engine for various frameworks
- Submission validation and verification system
- Package completeness checking and validation
- Submission tracking and status monitoring

### Regulatory Framework Support
- FedRAMP authorization package requirements
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework reporting
- SOC 2 compliance documentation
- ISO 27001 certification packages
- Custom regulatory framework adaptation

### Validation and Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive submission validation rules
- Document completeness verification
- Format compliance checking
- Content accuracy validation
- Regulatory requirement coverage analysis

## Implementation Details
