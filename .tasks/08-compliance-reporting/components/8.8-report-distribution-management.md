# 8.8: Report Distribution & Management

## Overview
Implement automated report distribution, access control, archival/retention, and analytics tracking. This component manages the complete lifecycle of reports from generation through distribution, storage, and analytics.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Automated report distribution with configurable schedules
- Role-based access control and permissions management
- Report archival and retention policy enforcement
- Report analytics and usage tracking
- Subscription management and user preferences
- Delivery notification and confirmation system

### Distribution Framework
- Multi-channel delivery support (email, file share, API)
- Configurable delivery schedules and frequencies
- Recipient management and group distribution
- Delivery confirmation and failure handling
- Format preference management
- Bandwidth and resource optimization

### Access Control System
- Role-based permissions and security
- Report-level access controls
- Content filtering and redaction
- Audit logging of access activities
- Group-based permission inheritance
- Dynamic access rule evaluation

### Analytics and Tracking
- Report usage and access analytics
- User engagement and interaction tracking
- Performance metrics and optimization
- Delivery success and failure analysis
- System utilization and capacity planning

## Implementation Details

### Automated Distribution
- Configurable delivery schedules and triggers
