# 8.1.1: Create Report Template Framework

## Overview
Build the foundational framework for configurable report templates with support for dynamic content placeholders and template inheritance. Implement core template structure and processing engine.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Framework Components
- Template parsing and compilation engine
- Template inheritance and composition system
- Dynamic placeholder resolution mechanism
- Template context management and data binding
- Error handling and validation framework
- Template caching and performance optimization

### Template Structure
- Hierarchical template organization with base templates
- Section-based template composition
- Conditional rendering and control structures
- Loop and iteration support for dynamic content
- Variable scoping and context isolation
- Template metadata and configuration management

### Processing Engine
- Template compilation and optimization
- Runtime template execution
- Context data injection and transformation
- Output generation and formatting
- Error detection and reporting
- Performance monitoring and profiling

## Implementation Details

### Template Parser
- Syntax definition and grammar specification
- Lexical analysis and tokenization
- Abstract syntax tree (AST) generation
- Semantic analysis and validation
- Optimization and code generation
- Error recovery and reporting

### Inheritance System
- Base template definition and extension
- Block and section override mechanisms
- Template composition and inclusion
- Dependency resolution and loading
- Circular dependency detection
- Version compatibility management

### Context Management
- Data source abstraction and integration
- Variable resolution and scoping
- Type checking and conversion
- Security and access control
- Performance optimization and caching
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Template parser handles complex template syntax correctly
- [ ] Inheritance system supports multi-level template hierarchies
- [ ] Dynamic placeholders resolve data from multiple sources
- [ ] Context management provides secure data access
- [ ] Error handling provides clear diagnostic messages
- [ ] Performance meets sub-second processing requirements

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Template syntax is intuitive and well-documented
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable guidance
- [ ] Framework is extensible for future enhancements
- [ ] Code coverage exceeds 90% for all components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet established targets

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Template execution is sandboxed and secure
- [ ] Data access controls prevent unauthorized information disclosure
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Template compilation is safe from malicious code

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Template parsing accuracy and error handling
- Inheritance resolution and composition logic
- Context data binding and transformation
- Security and access control validation
- Performance and memory usage optimization
- Error recovery and diagnostic reporting

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end template processing workflow
- Data source integration and retrieval
- Template library integration and management
- Performance under concurrent load
- Error handling across system boundaries

### Performance Tests
- Template compilation and execution speed
- Memory usage and garbage collection
- Concurrent template processing
- Large template and dataset handling
- Cache effectiveness and optimization

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Data Models (1.2) - for data structure definitions
- Configuration Management System - for template settings
- Logging and Monitoring Framework - for diagnostics

### External Dependencies
- Template processing library (Jinja2, Handlebars, etc.)
- Data serialization libraries (JSON, YAML)
- Caching system (Redis, Memcached)
- Security and validation libraries

## Estimated Effort
**16 hours**

### Task Breakdown
- Template parser implementation: 6 hours
- Inheritance system development: 4 hours
- Context management framework: 4 hours
- Testing and validation: 2 hours

## Acceptance Testing
