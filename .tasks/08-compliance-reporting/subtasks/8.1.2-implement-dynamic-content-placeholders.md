# 8.1.2: Implement Dynamic Content Placeholders

## Overview
Develop system for dynamic content placeholders that can pull data from various sources (databases, APIs, files) and inject into templates with proper formatting and validation.

## Technical Requirements

### Placeholder System
- Dynamic placeholder syntax and parsing
- Data source abstraction and integration
- Type-aware data binding and conversion
- Formatting and transformation functions
- Validation and error handling
- Performance optimization and caching

### Data Source Integration
- Database query execution and result mapping
- REST API integration and response handling
- File system access and content parsing
- Real-time data streaming and updates
- Authentication and authorization for data sources
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Content Processing
- Data transformation and formatting functions
- Conditional content generation
- Aggregation and calculation operations
- Date/time formatting and localization
- Number formatting and currency handling
- Text processing and manipulation

## Implementation Details

### Placeholder Parser
- Syntax definition for placeholder expressions
- Expression parsing and validation
- Function call resolution and execution
- Variable reference and scoping
- Type checking and conversion
- Error detection and reporting

### Data Source Connectors
- Database connection pooling and management
- SQL query generation and execution
- API client implementation and configuration
- File reader and parser implementation
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Connection health monitoring and recovery

### Formatting Engine
- Built-in formatting functions library
- Custom formatter registration and execution
- Locale-aware formatting and internationalization
- Template-specific formatting rules
- Performance optimization and caching
- Error handling and fallback formatting
