# 8.1.3: Build Multi-Format Rendering (PDF, DOCX, HTML)

## Overview
Implement rendering engines for multiple output formats including PDF generation, DOCX creation, and HTML output with consistent styling and layout across formats.

## Technical Requirements

### Multi-Format Architecture
- Format-specific rendering pipeline implementation
- Consistent styling and layout engine
- Format conversion and optimization
- Template-to-format mapping system
- Performance optimization for each format
- Quality assurance and validation

### PDF Generation
- High-quality PDF document creation
- Professional formatting and typography
- Page layout and pagination control
- Header, footer, and watermark support
- Table and chart rendering
- Accessibility and compliance features

### DOCX Creation
- Microsoft Word document generation
- Style and formatting preservation
- Table and list structure support
- Image and chart embedding
- Document metadata and properties
- Template compatibility and validation

### HTML Output
- Responsive web-friendly HTML generation
- CSS styling and layout optimization
- Interactive element support
- Print-friendly formatting options
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Implementation Details

### Rendering Pipeline
- Template processing and content extraction
- Format-specific transformation logic
