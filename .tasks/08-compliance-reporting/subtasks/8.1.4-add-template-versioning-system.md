# 8.1.4: Add Template Versioning System

## Overview
Create version control system for templates including version tracking, rollback capabilities, change history, and template migration tools for backward compatibility.

## Technical Requirements

### Version Control Framework
- Semantic versioning for template releases
- Change tracking and audit trail maintenance
- Branch and merge support for template development
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Migration tools for version upgrades
- Compatibility matrix and validation

### Change Management
- Template modification tracking and logging
- User attribution and timestamp recording
- Change approval and review workflows
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Merge conflict handling and resolution
- Change impact analysis and reporting

### Migration System
- Automated template migration between versions
- Backward compatibility validation and testing
- Data structure transformation and mapping
- Breaking change detection and notification
- Migration rollback and recovery procedures
- Version compatibility verification

## Implementation Details

### Version Storage
- Template version repository and storage
- Metadata and change log maintenance
- Binary diff and delta storage optimization
- Version indexing and retrieval system
- Backup and archival procedures
- Performance optimization for large repositories

### Change Tracking
- Template modification detection and logging
- User action tracking and attribution
- Timestamp and metadata recording
- Change categorization and classification
- Impact analysis and dependency tracking
- Audit trail generation and maintenance

### Migration Engine
- Version comparison and analysis
- Automated migration script generation
- Data transformation and validation
- Compatibility testing and verification
- Rollback procedure implementation
- Migration status tracking and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Version control tracks all template changes with full history
- [ ] Rollback capabilities restore previous template versions
- [ ] Migration tools handle version upgrades automatically
- [ ] Change tracking provides complete audit trail
- [ ] Compatibility validation prevents breaking changes
- [ ] Performance optimized for large template repositories

### Version Management Requirements
- [ ] Semantic versioning follows established standards
- [ ] Branch and merge operations support collaborative development
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles overlapping changes
- [ ] Change approval workflows enforce quality controls
- [ ] Impact analysis identifies affected components

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Version integrity maintained through checksums and validation
- [ ] Migration procedures tested and validated
- [ ] Rollback operations complete successfully
- [ ] Performance meets repository size requirements
- [ ] Documentation covers all versioning features

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Version creation and storage functionality
- Change tracking and audit trail accuracy
- Migration script generation and execution
- Rollback procedure validation
- Conflict detection and resolution logic
- Performance optimization effectiveness

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end versioning workflow testing
- Template repository integration
- Migration between multiple versions
- Collaborative development scenarios
- Large repository performance testing

### Regression Tests
- Version compatibility validation
- Migration accuracy and data integrity
- Rollback procedure verification
- Performance benchmarking
- Stress testing with large repositories

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Report Template Framework (8.1.1) - for template structure
- Database System - for version storage and metadata
- User Management System - for change attribution

### External Dependencies
- Version control libraries (Git, SVN)
- Database storage system
- Backup and archival systems
- Diff and merge utilities
- Checksum and validation libraries

## Estimated Effort
**16 hours**

### Task Breakdown
