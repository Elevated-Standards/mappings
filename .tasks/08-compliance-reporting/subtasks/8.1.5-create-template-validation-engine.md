# 8.1.5: Create Template Validation Engine

## Overview
Build validation system to ensure template syntax correctness, placeholder validity, format compliance, and content structure verification before template deployment.

## Technical Requirements

### Validation Framework
- Comprehensive syntax validation and error detection
- Placeholder reference validation and verification
- Format compliance checking and enforcement
- Content structure validation and schema verification
- Performance optimization for large templates
- Extensible rule system for custom validations

### Syntax Validation
- Template syntax parsing and error detection
- Grammar compliance verification
- Reserved keyword and function validation
- Nested structure validation and balancing
- Expression syntax and type checking
- Error location identification and reporting

### Content Validation
- Data source reference verification
- Placeholder existence and accessibility validation
- Format-specific content structure checking
- Required section and element validation
- Content length and size limit enforcement
- Security and injection attack prevention

## Implementation Details

### Validation Engine
- Rule-based validation system architecture
- Configurable validation rule sets
- Parallel validation processing for performance
- Detailed error reporting and diagnostics
- Validation result caching and optimization
- Integration with template processing pipeline

### Syntax Checker
- Template parser integration for syntax validation
- Abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis
- Semantic validation and type checking
- Cross-reference validation and dependency checking
- Performance optimization for complex templates
- Error recovery and continued validation

### Content Validator
- Data source connectivity and access validation
- Placeholder resolution and type verification
- Format-specific structure and schema validation
- Security scanning for malicious content
- Performance and resource usage validation
- Compliance checking for regulatory requirements
