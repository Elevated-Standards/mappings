# 8.1.6: Implement Template Library Management

## Overview
Develop template library system with categorization, search functionality, template sharing, access controls, and template metadata management for organizational use.

## Technical Requirements

### Library Management System
- Template categorization and organization
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Template sharing and collaboration features
- Role-based access control and permissions
- Metadata management and tagging system
- Usage analytics and reporting

### Template Organization
- Hierarchical category structure
- Tag-based classification system
- Template relationship and dependency mapping
- Collection and folder organization
- Favorite and bookmark functionality
- Recent and frequently used tracking

### Search and Discovery
- Full-text search across template content
- Metadata-based filtering and sorting
- Advanced query capabilities
- Search result ranking and relevance
- Saved search and alert functionality
- Recommendation engine for template suggestions

## Implementation Details

### Library Architecture
- Template repository and storage system
- Metadata database and indexing
- Search engine integration and optimization
- Access control and permission management
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Backup and synchronization mechanisms

### Categorization System
- Dynamic category creation and management
- Template classification and auto-tagging
- Relationship mapping and dependency tracking
- Collection management and organization
- Bulk operations and batch processing
- Import and export functionality

### Access Control
- Role-based permission system
- Template-level access controls
- Sharing and collaboration permissions
- Audit logging and activity tracking
- Group-based access management
- External user access and guest permissions
