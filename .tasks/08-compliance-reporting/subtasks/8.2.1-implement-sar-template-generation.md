# 8.2.1: Implement SAR Template and Generation

## Overview
Create Security Assessment Report (SAR) template compliant with FedRAMP requirements and implement automated generation from assessment data with proper formatting and required sections.

## Technical Requirements

### SAR Template Structure
- FedRAMP Rev 5 compliant template format
- Required sections and subsections organization
- Control assessment result integration
- Testing procedure documentation
- Finding and recommendation sections
- Evidence attachment and referencing

### Automated Generation
- Assessment data aggregation and processing
- Control-by-control result compilation
- Testing procedure result integration
- Finding classification and prioritization
- Risk assessment and impact analysis
- Evidence collection and organization

### Compliance Requirements
- FedRAMP template format adherence
- NIST SP 800-53 control mapping
- Required documentation completeness
- Regulatory submission standards
- Quality assurance and validation

## Implementation Details

### Template Design
- Section-based template structure
- Dynamic content placeholders for assessment data
- Conditional rendering for applicable controls
- Table and chart generation for results
- Appendix and attachment management
- Formatting and styling consistency

### Data Integration
- Assessment platform data retrieval
- Control implementation status aggregation
- Testing result compilation and analysis
- Finding categorization and severity assignment
- Risk scoring and impact assessment
- Evidence linking and referencing

### Generation Engine
- Template processing and content injection
- Multi-format output generation (PDF, DOCX)
- Quality validation and compliance checking
- Error handling and diagnostic reporting
- Performance optimization for large assessments
- Batch processing for multiple systems
