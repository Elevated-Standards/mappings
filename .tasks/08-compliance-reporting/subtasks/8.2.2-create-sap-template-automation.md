# 8.2.2: Create SAP Template and Automation

## Overview
Develop Security Assessment Plan (SAP) template and automation system to generate assessment plans based on control selection, testing procedures, and assessment methodology requirements.

## Technical Requirements

### SAP Template Framework
- FedRAMP SAP template structure and format
- Control selection and baseline integration
- Testing procedure assignment and documentation
- Assessment methodology specification
- Resource allocation and timeline planning
- Stakeholder responsibility matrix

### Automation Engine
- Control baseline selection automation
- Testing procedure assignment logic
- Resource requirement calculation
- Timeline generation and optimization
- Stakeholder assignment and notification
- Quality assurance and validation

### Assessment Planning
- Control prioritization and risk-based selection
- Testing methodology selection and configuration
- Resource estimation and allocation
- Timeline planning and milestone definition
- Dependency identification and management
- Approval workflow and sign-off process

## Implementation Details

### Template Structure
- Executive summary and assessment overview
- Control selection rationale and methodology
- Testing procedure specifications
- Resource requirements and allocation
- Timeline and milestone definitions
- Roles and responsibilities matrix

### Control Selection Logic
- Baseline control set determination
- Risk-based control prioritization
- Tailoring and customization rules
- Control family grouping and organization
- Testing frequency and scheduling
- Sampling methodology and criteria

### Resource Planning
- Assessor skill requirement analysis
