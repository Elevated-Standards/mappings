# 8.3.2: Implement Evidence Documentation System

## Overview
Build system to document and organize implementation evidence for each control including artifacts, screenshots, configuration files, and supporting documentation with proper categorization.

## Technical Requirements

### Evidence Management Framework
- Multi-type evidence support (documents, images, configs, logs)
- Automated evidence collection and cataloging
- Evidence categorization and tagging system
- Version control and change tracking
- Quality validation and integrity checking
- Search and retrieval capabilities

### Documentation System
- Evidence metadata extraction and management
- Automated documentation generation
- Cross-reference and linking capabilities
- Template-based evidence presentation
- Audit trail and chain of custody
- Access control and security

## Implementation Details

### Evidence Collector
- Automated artifact collection from multiple sources
- File type detection and validation
- Metadata extraction and enrichment
- Duplicate detection and deduplication
- Quality assessment and scoring
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Organization Engine
- Hierarchical categorization system
- Tag-based classification and filtering
- Control-specific evidence grouping
- Timeline and chronological organization
- Relationship mapping and cross-referencing
- Search indexing and optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Evidence collection supports all artifact types
- [ ] Automated categorization and organization
- [ ] Quality validation ensures evidence integrity
- [ ] Search and retrieval efficient and accurate
