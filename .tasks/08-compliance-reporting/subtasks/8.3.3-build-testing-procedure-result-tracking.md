# 8.3.3: Build Testing Procedure Result Tracking

## Overview
Create system to track and document testing procedure results including test execution status, findings, evidence collection, and result validation for each control assessment.

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Framework
- Test procedure definition and management
- Execution status tracking and monitoring
- Result documentation and validation
- Finding classification and severity assignment
- Evidence linking and organization
- Quality assurance and review workflows

### Result Management
- Test result aggregation and analysis
- Finding categorization and prioritization
- Evidence collection and validation
- Cross-reference and dependency tracking
- Timeline and milestone monitoring
- Approval and sign-off processes

## Implementation Details

### Test Execution Engine
- Automated test procedure execution
- Manual test result input and validation
- Status tracking and progress monitoring
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Integration with testing tools

### Result Processor
