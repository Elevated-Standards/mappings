# 8.5.2: Implement NIST Compliance Report Generation

## Overview
Build automated generation system for NIST framework compliance reports including control mappings, implementation status, and assessment results with framework-specific formatting.

## Technical Requirements

### NIST Framework Support
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework compliance reporting
- NIST SP 800-53 control mapping and status
- Framework-specific report templates
- Implementation status tracking and reporting
- Assessment result integration and analysis
- Gap analysis and remediation planning

### Report Generation Engine
- Automated NIST report creation
- Control mapping and cross-reference validation
- Implementation status aggregation
- Assessment result compilation
- Gap identification and analysis
- Remediation recommendation generation

## Implementation Details

### Framework Processor
- NIST framework structure and requirements
- Control mapping and relationship management
- Implementation status calculation
- Assessment result aggregation
- Gap analysis and identification
- Compliance scoring and rating

### Report Generator
- Framework-specific template processing
- Automated content population
- Control status and evidence integration
- Gap analysis and remediation planning
- Quality validation and compliance checking
- Multi-format output generation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] NIST reports generated automatically from current data
- [ ] Control mappings accurate and comprehensive
- [ ] Implementation status reflects current state
- [ ] Assessment results properly integrated
- [ ] Gap analysis identifies all deficiencies
- [ ] Framework-specific formatting maintained

### Compliance Requirements
- [ ] All NIST framework requirements addressed
- [ ] Control mappings validated and accurate

- Control Mapping Engine - for NIST mappings
- Assessment Platform - for implementation status

### External Dependencies
- NIST framework specifications
- Control catalog and mappings
- Assessment methodology standards

## Estimated Effort
**16 hours**

### Task Breakdown
- NIST framework integration: 6 hours
- Report generation engine: 6 hours
- Gap analysis implementation: 3 hours
- Testing and validation: 1 hour
