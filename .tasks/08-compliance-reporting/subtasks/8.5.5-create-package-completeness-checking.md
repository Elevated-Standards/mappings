# 8.5.5: Create Package Completeness Checking

## Overview
Build automated checking system to ensure all required documents, artifacts, and supporting materials are included in submission packages with dependency validation and missing item alerts.

## Technical Requirements

### Completeness Framework
- Required document identification and tracking
- Artifact and supporting material validation
- Dependency checking and verification
- Missing item detection and alerting
- Package integrity and consistency checking
- Automated remediation guidance

### Checking Engine
- Comprehensive package inventory and validation
- Document and artifact verification
- Dependency resolution and validation
- Missing component identification
- Quality assessment and scoring
- Alert generation and notification

## Implementation Details

### Package Inspector
- Complete package inventory and cataloging
- Required component identification
- Document and artifact verification
- Dependency mapping and validation
- Missing item detection and classification
- Quality assessment and reporting

### Alert System
- Missing item identification and notification
- Dependency violation detection and alerting
- Quality issue identification and reporting
- Remediation guidance and recommendations
- Progress tracking and resolution monitoring
- Stakeholder notification and communication
