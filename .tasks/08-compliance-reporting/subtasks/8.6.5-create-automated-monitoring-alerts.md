# 8.6.5: Create Automated Monitoring Alerts

## Overview
Build intelligent alerting system for continuous monitoring that detects compliance deviations, control failures, security incidents, and performance degradation with configurable thresholds and escalation procedures.

## Technical Requirements

### Alert Framework
- Intelligent alert generation and classification
- Configurable threshold and trigger management
- Multi-channel notification and delivery
- Escalation procedures and workflows
- Alert correlation and deduplication
- Performance optimization and scalability

### Detection Engine
- Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
- Compliance deviation identification
- Control failure detection and analysis
- Security incident correlation
- Performance degradation monitoring
- Quality assurance and false positive reduction

## Implementation Details

### Alert Generator
- Rule-based alert creation and classification
- Threshold monitoring and trigger processing
- Alert correlation and deduplication
- Priority assignment and escalation
- Notification formatting and delivery
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Notification System
- Multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, dashboard)
- Stakeholder-specific routing and filtering
- Escalation workflow and timeline management
- Acknowledgment tracking and resolution
- Alert history and audit trail
- Performance metrics and reporting
