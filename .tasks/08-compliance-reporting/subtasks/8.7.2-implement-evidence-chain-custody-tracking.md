# 8.7.2: Implement Evidence Chain of Custody Tracking

## Overview
Build comprehensive chain of custody tracking system for compliance evidence including creation, modification, access, transfer, and disposal records with tamper-proof audit trails and digital signatures.

## Technical Requirements

### Chain of Custody Framework
- Evidence lifecycle tracking and management
- Creation and modification audit trails
- Access control and authorization logging
- Transfer and handoff documentation
- Disposal and retention management
- Tamper-proof audit trail generation

### Security and Integrity
- Digital signature and verification
- Cryptographic hash validation
- Tamper detection and alerting
- Access control and authorization
- Audit trail immutability
- Compliance and regulatory adherence

## Implementation Details

### Custody Tracker
- Evidence lifecycle state management
- Activity logging and audit trail creation
- Access control and permission enforcement
- Transfer documentation and validation
- Integrity checking and verification
- Quality assurance and compliance validation

### Security Engine
- Digital signature generation and verification
- Cryptographic hash calculation and validation
- Tamper detection and alert generation
- Access control enforcement
- Audit trail protection and immutability
- Compliance verification and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Evidence tracked throughout complete lifecycle
- [ ] Chain of custody maintained and documented
- [ ] Access control enforced and logged
- [ ] Transfers properly documented and validated
