# 8.8.1: Create Automated Report Distribution

## Overview
Build automated report distribution system with configurable schedules, stakeholder-specific delivery, multiple format support, and delivery confirmation tracking with retry mechanisms.

## Technical Requirements

### Distribution Framework
- Automated scheduling and delivery management
- Stakeholder-specific distribution lists and preferences
- Multi-format report generation and delivery
- Delivery confirmation and tracking
- Retry mechanisms and error handling
- Performance optimization and scalability

### Delivery Engine
- Scheduled report generation and processing
- Multi-channel delivery (email, portal, API)
- Format conversion and optimization
- Delivery status tracking and confirmation
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Implementation Details

### Distribution Manager
- Schedule management and processing
- Stakeholder preference management
- Report generation coordination
- Delivery channel selection and routing
- Status tracking and confirmation
- Quality assurance and validation

### Delivery Processor
- Multi-format report generation
- Delivery channel integration and processing
