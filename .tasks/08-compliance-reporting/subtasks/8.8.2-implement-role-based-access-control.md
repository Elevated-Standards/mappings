# 8.8.2: Implement Role-Based Access Control

## Overview
Implement comprehensive role-based access control system for reports and compliance data including granular permissions, data classification, access logging, and compliance with security frameworks.

## Technical Requirements

### Access Control Framework
- Role-based permission management
- Granular access control and authorization
- Data classification and sensitivity handling
- Access logging and audit trails
- Security framework compliance
- Performance optimization and scalability

### Permission Engine
- Role definition and management
- Permission assignment and enforcement
- Data classification and labeling
- Access request processing and validation
- Audit trail generation and maintenance
- Quality assurance and compliance checking

## Implementation Details

### Access Manager
- Role hierarchy and permission management
- User assignment and authorization
- Data classification and access control
- Permission enforcement and validation
- Access request processing and approval
- Quality validation and verification

### Security Enforcer
- Real-time access control enforcement
- Permission validation and authorization
- Data sensitivity and classification handling
- Audit trail generation and logging
- Security compliance verification
- Performance optimization and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Role-based permissions enforced consistently
- [ ] Granular access control supports data sensitivity
- [ ] Data classification properly implemented and enforced
- [ ] Access logging comprehensive and tamper-proof
- [ ] Security framework compliance verified
