# Deployment-1: Create Containerization Strategy

## Overview
Develop comprehensive containerization strategy for compliance reporting components using Docker and Kubernetes with optimized images, orchestration, and deployment automation.

## Technical Requirements

### Container Framework
- Docker image optimization and security
- Multi-stage build processes
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Service mesh integration and management
- Resource allocation and scaling
- Security scanning and compliance

### Deployment Orchestration
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Rolling updates and blue-green deployments
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Resource monitoring and auto-scaling
- Configuration and secret management

## Implementation Details

### Container Builder
- Optimized Dockerfile creation
- Multi-stage build implementation
- Security hardening and scanning
- Image versioning and tagging
- Registry management and distribution
- Performance optimization

### Orchestration Manager
- Kubernetes manifest generation
- Service mesh configuration
- Deployment strategy implementation
- Health monitoring and recovery
- Scaling and resource management
- Security policy enforcement

## Acceptance Criteria
