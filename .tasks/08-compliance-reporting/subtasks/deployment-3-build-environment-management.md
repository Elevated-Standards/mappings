# Deployment-3: Build Environment Management

## Overview
Create comprehensive environment management system for development, testing, staging, and production environments with automated provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management.

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Framework
- Multi-environment support and isolation
- Automated environment provisioning
- Configuration management and synchronization
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Environment lifecycle management
- Compliance and security enforcement

### Environment Controller
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation
- Environment template management
- Automated provisioning and deprovisioning
- Configuration drift detection and correction
- Resource monitoring and optimization
- Security and compliance validation

## Implementation Details

### Environment Manager
- Environment definition and templating
- Automated provisioning workflows
- Configuration synchronization
- Resource allocation and scaling
- Lifecycle management and cleanup
- Quality assurance and validation

### Infrastructure Controller
- IaC template management and execution
- Resource provisioning and configuration
- Environment monitoring and health checking
- Security policy enforcement
- Compliance validation and reporting
- Performance optimization and tuning

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Environments provisioned automatically and consistently
- [ ] Configuration synchronized across environment types
- [ ] Resource allocation optimized for each environment
- [ ] Environment lifecycle managed automatically
- [ ] Security and compliance enforced consistently
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code properly implemented

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Environment management platforms
- Monitoring and compliance tools

## Estimated Effort
**16 hours**

### Task Breakdown
- Environment framework development: 6 hours
- Infrastructure as Code implementation: 6 hours
- Lifecycle management automation: 3 hours
- Testing and validation: 1 hour

## Definition of Done
