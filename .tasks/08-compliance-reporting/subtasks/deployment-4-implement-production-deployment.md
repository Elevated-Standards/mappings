- Blue-green and canary deployment support
- Health monitoring and validation
- Automated rollback and recovery
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security and compliance verification

### Deployment Orchestration
- Production deployment automation
- Health check and validation workflows
- Traffic routing and load balancing
- Monitoring and alerting integration
- Rollback trigger and execution
- Quality assurance and compliance

## Implementation Details
