# Integration-2: Create Database Integration Layer

## Overview
Build comprehensive database integration layer supporting multiple database types, connection pooling, transaction management, and data consistency across compliance reporting components.

## Technical Requirements

### Database Integration Framework
- Multi-database support and abstraction
- Connection pooling and management
- Transaction coordination and management
- Data consistency and integrity enforcement
- Performance optimization and caching
- Monitoring and health checking

### Data Access Layer
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) implementation
- Query optimization and performance tuning
- Data validation and constraint enforcement
- Audit trail and change tracking
- Backup and recovery coordination
- Security and access control

## Implementation Details

### Database Manager
- Connection pool configuration and management
- Transaction boundary management
