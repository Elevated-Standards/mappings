# Integration-3: Build Message Queue Integration

## Overview
Implement message queue integration for asynchronous processing, event-driven architecture, and reliable communication between compliance reporting components.

## Technical Requirements

### Message Queue Framework
- Asynchronous message processing
- Event-driven architecture support
- Message routing and delivery guarantees
- Dead letter queue handling
- Performance optimization and scaling
- Monitoring and alerting

### Queue Management
- Message serialization and deserialization
- Topic and queue management
- Consumer group coordination
- Message ordering and deduplication
- Retry mechanisms and error handling
- Performance monitoring and metrics

## Implementation Details

### Message Processor
- Asynchronous message handling
- Event routing and distribution
- Message transformation and validation
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimization
- Quality assurance and monitoring

### Queue Coordinator
- Queue configuration and management
- Consumer scaling and load balancing
- Message ordering and consistency
- Dead letter queue processing
- Performance monitoring
- Health checking and alerting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Asynchronous processing reliable and efficient
- [ ] Event-driven architecture properly implemented
