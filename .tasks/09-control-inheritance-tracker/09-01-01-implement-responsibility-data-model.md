# Implement Responsibility Data Model

## Overview
Create core data structures for multi-party responsibility modeling including responsibility types, ownership levels, and accountability relationships. Define schemas for responsibility entities and their attributes.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-party responsibility entity modeling
- Responsibility type definitions and attributes
- Ownership level classifications
- Accountability relationship mappings
- Schema design for scalability
- Data integrity constraints

## Implementation Details

### Data Model Components
1. **Responsibility Entity**: Core responsibility object with attributes
2. **Stakeholder Entity**: Parties responsible for controls (CSP, Customer, Shared)
3. **Ownership Levels**: Primary, Secondary, Shared, None classifications
4. **Accountability Relationships**: Links between stakeholders and responsibilities
5. **Responsibility Types**: Categorization system for different responsibility kinds
6. **Metadata Attributes**: Creation, modification, and audit information

### Schema Design
- Normalized database schema for responsibility entities
- Foreign key relationships for stakeholder associations
- Indexing strategy for performance optimization
- Data validation rules and constraints
- Version control for schema changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Responsibility entity model supports all required attributes
- [ ] Stakeholder entity model handles multiple party types
- [ ] Ownership level classifications are comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Accountability relationships are properly mapped and validated
- [ ] Schema design supports 1000+ responsibility assignments
- [ ] Data integrity constraints prevent invalid assignments
- [ ] Performance optimization through proper indexing
- [ ] Version control supports schema evolution

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Entity model validation
- Relationship mapping accuracy
- Data constraint enforcement
- Schema integrity verification
- Performance benchmarking
- Data migration testing

### Integration Tests
- Cross-entity relationship validation
- Database transaction integrity
- Concurrent access handling
- Data consistency verification

## Dependencies
- Database infrastructure
- ORM framework selection
- Data modeling standards
- Performance requirements specification

## Estimated Effort
**16-20 hours**
- Entity model design: 4-6 hours
- Schema implementation: 6-8 hours
- Relationship mapping: 3-4 hours
- Validation and constraints: 2-3 hours
- Testing and optimization: 1-2 hours

## Priority
**High** - Foundation for all responsibility tracking

## Success Metrics
- Support for multiple responsibility types
- Sub-second query performance for 1000+ records
- Zero data integrity violations
- Successful handling of concurrent operations
