# Create Inheritance Hierarchy Structure

## Overview
Build hierarchical structure for responsibility inheritance including parent-child relationships, inheritance rules, and hierarchy traversal mechanisms. Support nested inheritance levels.

## Technical Requirements
- Parent-child relationship modeling
- Inheritance rule definitions
- Hierarchy traversal algorithms
- Nested inheritance level support
- Circular dependency prevention
- Inheritance path validation

## Implementation Details

### Hierarchy Components
1. **Parent-Child Relationships**: Direct inheritance links between responsibilities
2. **Inheritance Rules**: Business logic governing inheritance behavior
3. **Traversal Algorithms**: Efficient hierarchy navigation methods
4. **Level Management**: Support for multiple nested inheritance levels
5. **Cycle Detection**: Prevention of circular inheritance dependencies
6. **Path Validation**: Verification of valid inheritance paths

### Hierarchy Features
- Tree structure for inheritance relationships
- Depth-first and breadth-first traversal options
- Inheritance rule engine for automatic propagation
- Performance optimization for large hierarchies
- Validation mechanisms for hierarchy integrity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parent-child relationships are properly modeled and enforced
- [ ] Inheritance rules govern automatic responsibility propagation
- [ ] Traversal algorithms efficiently navigate complex hierarchies
- [ ] Nested inheritance levels are supported without performance degradation
- [ ] Circular dependency detection prevents invalid hierarchies
- [ ] Path validation ensures inheritance integrity
- [ ] Performance remains optimal for hierarchies with 100+ levels
- [ ] Hierarchy modifications maintain data consistency

## Testing Requirements
