# Build Responsibility Type Categorization

## Overview
Implement categorization system for different responsibility types (shared, customer, CSP, hybrid) with clear definitions and classification rules. Support custom responsibility categories.

## Technical Requirements
- Responsibility type taxonomy
- Classification rule engine
- Custom category support
- Type validation mechanisms
- Category hierarchy management
- Type-specific behavior definitions

## Implementation Details

### Categorization Components
1. **Type Taxonomy**: Hierarchical classification system for responsibility types
2. **Classification Rules**: Automated categorization based on attributes
3. **Custom Categories**: User-defined responsibility types
4. **Validation Engine**: Type assignment validation and verification
5. **Behavior Definitions**: Type-specific processing rules
6. **Category Management**: CRUD operations for category administration

### Standard Categories
- **Shared**: Joint responsibility between multiple parties
- **Customer**: Customer-exclusive responsibility
- **CSP**: Cloud Service Provider-exclusive responsibility
- **Hybrid**: Mixed responsibility with specific conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Type taxonomy supports standard and custom categories
- [ ] Classification rules automatically categorize responsibilities
- [ ] Custom category creation and management functionality
- [ ] Validation engine prevents invalid type assignments
- [ ] Category hierarchy supports nested classifications
- [ ] Type-specific behaviors are properly implemented
- [ ] Performance optimization for large category sets
- [ ] Category changes maintain data consistency

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Type taxonomy accuracy
- Classification rule effectiveness
- Custom category functionality
- Validation engine correctness
- Behavior definition compliance
- Performance benchmarking

### Integration Tests
- Cross-component type usage
- Category hierarchy navigation
- Type-specific workflow validation
- Data consistency verification

## Dependencies
- Responsibility data model
- Rule engine framework
- Category management interface
- Validation framework

## Estimated Effort
**16-20 hours**
- Type taxonomy design: 4-5 hours
- Classification rules: 5-6 hours
- Custom category support: 3-4 hours
- Validation engine: 2-3 hours
- Testing and optimization: 2-3 hours

## Priority
**High** - Essential for responsibility classification

## Success Metrics
- Support for 20+ responsibility categories
- Accurate automatic classification
- Flexible custom category creation
- Zero type assignment conflicts
