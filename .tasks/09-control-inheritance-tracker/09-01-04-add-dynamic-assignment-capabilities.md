# Add Dynamic Assignment Capabilities

## Overview
Create dynamic responsibility assignment engine that can automatically assign responsibilities based on service models, control types, and organizational policies. Include assignment validation.

## Technical Requirements
- Automated assignment algorithms
- Service model-based assignment rules
- Control type-specific assignment logic
- Organizational policy integration
- Assignment validation mechanisms
- Real-time assignment updates

## Implementation Details

### Assignment Engine Components
1. **Assignment Algorithms**: Rule-based automatic responsibility assignment
2. **Service Model Rules**: IaaS/PaaS/SaaS-specific assignment logic
3. **Control Type Logic**: Assignment based on control characteristics
4. **Policy Integration**: Organizational policy-driven assignments
5. **Validation Framework**: Assignment verification and conflict detection
6. **Update Mechanisms**: Real-time assignment propagation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Assignment engine automatically assigns responsibilities based on rules
- [ ] Service model rules correctly distribute responsibilities
- [ ] Control type logic handles different control characteristics
- [ ] Policy integration supports organizational requirements
- [ ] Validation framework prevents invalid assignments
- [ ] Real-time updates maintain assignment consistency
- [ ] Performance optimization for bulk assignments
- [ ] Assignment audit trail for compliance

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Assignment algorithm accuracy
- Service model rule compliance
- Control type logic validation
