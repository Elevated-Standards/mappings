# Create Responsibility Conflict Detection

## Overview
Implement conflict detection algorithms to identify overlapping or contradictory responsibility assignments. Provide conflict resolution recommendations and automated resolution where possible.

## Technical Requirements
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Overlap identification mechanisms
- Contradiction analysis systems
- Resolution recommendation engine
- Automated conflict resolution
- Conflict reporting and tracking

## Implementation Details

### Conflict Detection Components
1. **Overlap Detection**: Identify multiple assignments for same responsibility
2. **Contradiction Analysis**: Find conflicting responsibility assignments
3. **Resolution Engine**: Automated and manual conflict resolution
4. **Recommendation System**: Suggest optimal conflict resolutions
5. **Conflict Tracking**: Monitor and report conflict resolution progress
6. **Prevention Mechanisms**: Proactive conflict prevention

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Overlap detection identifies multiple assignments accurately
- [ ] Contradiction analysis finds conflicting assignments
- [ ] Resolution engine provides automated and manual options
- [ ] Recommendation system suggests optimal resolutions
- [ ] Conflict tracking monitors resolution progress
- [ ] Prevention mechanisms reduce future conflicts
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time detection
- [ ] Integration with validation and assignment systems

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Overlap detection accuracy
- Contradiction analysis effectiveness
- Resolution algorithm correctness
- Recommendation quality validation
- Prevention mechanism reliability

## Dependencies
- Responsibility validation rules
- Assignment engine
- Resolution workflow system
- Notification framework

## Estimated Effort
**12-16 hours**

## Priority
**High** - Essential for data consistency
