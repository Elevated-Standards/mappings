# Responsibility Model Framework

## Overview
Implement multi-party responsibility modeling with inheritance hierarchy management, responsibility type categorization, and dynamic assignment capabilities. This forms the foundational framework for all responsibility tracking within the Control Inheritance Tracker system.

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-party responsibility modeling
- Inheritance hierarchy management
- Responsibility type categorization
- Dynamic responsibility assignment
- Responsibility validation rules
- Conflict detection and resolution

## Implementation Details

### Core Data Structures
- Responsibility entity models with attributes for ownership levels
- Stakeholder relationship mappings
- Responsibility type definitions and classifications
- Inheritance rule definitions and constraints

### Key Components
1. **Responsibility Data Model**: Core schemas and entity relationships
2. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships and traversal mechanisms
3. **Type Categorization**: Classification system for responsibility types
4. **Dynamic Assignment**: Automated assignment engine with validation
5. **Validation Rules**: Business rule engine for responsibility assignments
6. **Conflict Detection**: Algorithms for identifying and resolving conflicts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Responsibility data model supports multi-party scenarios
- [ ] Inheritance hierarchy handles nested levels correctly
- [ ] Type categorization supports shared, customer, CSP, and hybrid types
- [ ] Dynamic assignment engine validates assignments automatically
- [ ] Validation rules ensure complete responsibility coverage
- [ ] Conflict detection identifies overlapping assignments
- [ ] System handles 1000+ responsibility assignments efficiently
- [ ] All responsibility types are properly categorized and tracked

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Responsibility model data integrity
- Inheritance hierarchy traversal accuracy
- Type categorization logic validation
- Dynamic assignment rule compliance
- Validation rule effectiveness
- Conflict detection algorithm accuracy

### Integration Tests
- Cross-component responsibility tracking
- Real-time assignment updates
- Validation rule integration
- Conflict resolution workflows

## Dependencies
- Data Models (1.2) - Core data structure definitions
- Control data structure - Control entity definitions
- Database schema design
- Authentication and authorization system

## Estimated Effort
**Total: 96-128 hours (3-4 days)**
- Responsibility data model: 16-20 hours
- Inheritance hierarchy: 16-20 hours
- Type categorization: 16-20 hours
- Dynamic assignment: 20-24 hours
- Validation rules: 16-20 hours
- Conflict detection: 12-16 hours
- Testing and validation: 8-12 hours

## Priority
**High** - Foundation component required by all other modules

## Success Metrics
- Support for multiple responsibility types
- Accurate inheritance chain tracking
- Zero responsibility assignment conflicts
- Sub-second response time for assignment operations
- 100% test coverage for core functionality
