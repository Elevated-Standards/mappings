# Create Service Model Mappings (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS)

## Overview
Build comprehensive mappings between service models and responsibility distributions. Define clear responsibility boundaries for Infrastructure, Platform, and Software as a Service models.

## Technical Requirements
- Service model responsibility mappings
- Clear boundary definitions
- Responsibility distribution algorithms
- Model-specific validation rules
- Cross-model compatibility
- Mapping visualization capabilities

## Implementation Details
### Mapping Components
1. **IaaS Mappings**: Infrastructure service responsibility boundaries
2. **PaaS Mappings**: Platform service responsibility distributions
3. **SaaS Mappings**: Software service responsibility allocations
4. **Boundary Definitions**: Clear separation of responsibilities
5. **Distribution Algorithms**: Automated responsibility assignment
6. **Validation Rules**: Model-specific compliance checking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] IaaS mappings define infrastructure responsibility boundaries
- [ ] PaaS mappings cover platform service responsibilities
- [ ] SaaS mappings address software service allocations
- [ ] Boundary definitions prevent responsibility gaps
- [ ] Distribution algorithms automate assignments
- [ ] Validation rules ensure model compliance
- [ ] Cross-model compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance optimization for mapping operations

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Mapping accuracy validation
- Boundary definition correctness
- Distribution algorithm effectiveness
- Validation rule compliance
- Cross-model compatibility

## Dependencies
- Service model definitions
- CSP responsibility templates
- Responsibility data model
- Validation framework

## Estimated Effort
**20-24 hours**

## Priority
**High** - Core service model functionality
