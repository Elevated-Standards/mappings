# Build Infrastructure Control Inheritance

## Overview
Implement infrastructure-level control inheritance mechanisms where CSP infrastructure controls automatically inherit to customer environments. Track inherited control effectiveness.

## Technical Requirements
- Infrastructure control inheritance algorithms
- Automatic inheritance propagation
- Customer environment mapping
- Inherited control effectiveness tracking
- Inheritance validation mechanisms
- Performance optimization for large-scale inheritance

## Implementation Details
### Inheritance Components
1. **Inheritance Algorithms**: Automatic infrastructure control propagation
2. **Environment Mapping**: Customer environment inheritance tracking
3. **Effectiveness Tracking**: Inherited control performance monitoring
4. **Validation Mechanisms**: Inheritance integrity verification
5. **Propagation Engine**: Real-time inheritance updates
6. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient large-scale processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inheritance algorithms automatically propagate infrastructure controls
- [ ] Environment mapping tracks customer inheritance accurately
- [ ] Effectiveness tracking monitors inherited control performance
- [ ] Validation mechanisms ensure inheritance integrity
- [ ] Propagation engine provides real-time updates
- [ ] Performance optimization handles large-scale inheritance
- [ ] Support for complex inheritance scenarios
- [ ] Integration with CSP capability documentation

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
