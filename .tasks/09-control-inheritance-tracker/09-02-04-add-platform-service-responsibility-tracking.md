# Add Platform Service Responsibility Tracking

## Overview
Create tracking system for platform service responsibilities including managed services, APIs, and platform-specific security controls. Support multi-tenant platform scenarios.

## Technical Requirements
- Platform service responsibility tracking
- Managed service responsibility mapping
- API responsibility assignment
- Platform-specific security controls
- Multi-tenant scenario support
- Real-time tracking capabilities

## Implementation Details
### Tracking Components
1. **Service Tracking**: Platform service responsibility monitoring
2. **Managed Service Mapping**: Responsibility assignment for managed services
3. **API Responsibility**: API-specific responsibility tracking
4. **Security Controls**: Platform security control management
5. **Multi-tenant Support**: Tenant-specific responsibility tracking
6. **Real-time Updates**: Live responsibility status monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Platform service tracking covers all service types
- [ ] Managed service mapping assigns responsibilities accurately
