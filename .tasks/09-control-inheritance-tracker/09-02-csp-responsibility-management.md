# CSP Responsibility Management

## Overview
Build Cloud Service Provider responsibility tracking with service model-specific responsibilities, infrastructure control inheritance, and platform service responsibilities. This module manages all CSP-related responsibility assignments and validations.

## Technical Requirements
- Cloud Service Provider responsibility tracking
- Service model-specific responsibilities (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS)
- Infrastructure control inheritance
- Platform service responsibilities
- CSP capability documentation
- Responsibility validation against CSP offerings

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **CSP Responsibility Templates**: Standardized templates for different CSP offerings
2. **Service Model Mappings**: Clear boundaries for IaaS/PaaS/SaaS responsibilities
3. **Infrastructure Inheritance**: Automatic inheritance of infrastructure controls
4. **Platform Service Tracking**: Managed services and API responsibility tracking
5. **Capability Documentation**: CSP security capabilities and certifications
6. **Validation System**: Verification against actual CSP capabilities

### Service Model Definitions
- **IaaS**: Infrastructure-level responsibilities and control inheritance
- **PaaS**: Platform service responsibilities and managed service controls
- **SaaS**: Software service responsibilities and application-level controls

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CSP responsibility templates cover major cloud providers
- [ ] Service model mappings clearly define responsibility boundaries
- [ ] Infrastructure control inheritance works automatically
- [ ] Platform service responsibilities are accurately tracked
- [ ] CSP capabilities are documented and linked to responsibilities
- [ ] Validation system verifies CSP responsibility assignments
- [ ] Support for multi-tenant platform scenarios
- [ ] Integration with CSP compliance documentation

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- CSP template accuracy and completeness
- Service model mapping correctness
- Infrastructure inheritance logic
- Platform service responsibility assignment
- Capability documentation validation
- CSP validation algorithm accuracy

### Integration Tests
- Cross-service model responsibility tracking
- Real-time CSP capability updates
- Template customization workflows
- Multi-provider responsibility management

## Dependencies
- Responsibility Model Framework (9.1) - Core responsibility modeling
- Service model definitions - Standard service model classifications
- CSP API integrations - For capability validation
- Compliance framework mappings

## Estimated Effort
**Total: 96-128 hours (3-4 days)**
- CSP responsibility templates: 20-24 hours
- Service model mappings: 20-24 hours
- Infrastructure control inheritance: 16-20 hours
- Platform service tracking: 16-20 hours
- CSP capability documentation: 12-16 hours
- CSP responsibility validation: 12-16 hours
- Testing and integration: 8-12 hours

## Priority
**High** - Critical for cloud service responsibility tracking

## Success Metrics
- Complete coverage of major CSP service models
- Accurate infrastructure control inheritance
- Real-time CSP capability validation
- Zero gaps in CSP responsibility assignments
- Support for 10+ major cloud service providers
