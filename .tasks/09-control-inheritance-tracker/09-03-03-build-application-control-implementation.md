# Build Application Control Implementation

## Overview
Implement application-level control tracking for customer-developed and customer-managed applications. Include code security, application architecture, and runtime security controls.

## Technical Requirements
- Application-level control tracking
- Customer application responsibility management
- Code security control implementation
- Application architecture security tracking
- Runtime security control monitoring
- Application lifecycle responsibility tracking

## Implementation Details
### Application Components
1. **Application Control Tracking**: Application-level security control monitoring
2. **Code Security Implementation**: Code security responsibility tracking
3. **Architecture Security**: Application architecture security controls
4. **Runtime Security**: Runtime security control monitoring
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Application lifecycle responsibility tracking
6. **Integration Monitoring**: Application integration security tracking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application control tracking covers customer applications
- [ ] Code security implementation tracks development responsibilities
