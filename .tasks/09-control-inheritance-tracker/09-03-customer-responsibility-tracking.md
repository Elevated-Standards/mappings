# Customer Responsibility Tracking

## Overview
Implement customer implementation responsibilities with configuration management tracking, application-level control implementation, and customer-specific requirements. This module manages all customer-side responsibility assignments and capability assessments.

## Technical Requirements
- Customer implementation responsibilities
- Configuration management tracking
- Application-level control implementation
- Customer-specific requirements handling
- Customer capability assessment
- Responsibility feasibility validation

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Customer Responsibility Templates**: Industry-specific and customizable templates
2. **Configuration Tracking**: Security settings and compliance configuration monitoring
3. **Application Control Implementation**: Customer-developed application security tracking
4. **Custom Requirements**: Customer-specific regulatory and organizational requirements
5. **Capability Assessment**: Security maturity and implementation capability evaluation
6. **Validation System**: Feasibility and resource requirement validation

### Configuration Management
- Security configuration tracking and drift detection
- Access control responsibility assignments
- Compliance configuration monitoring
- Configuration change impact assessment
