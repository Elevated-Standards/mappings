# Create Responsibility Gap Identification

## Overview
Implement gap identification system to detect unassigned responsibilities, incomplete coverage, and missing stakeholder assignments. Provide gap remediation recommendations.

## Technical Requirements
- Gap identification algorithms
- Unassigned responsibility detection
- Coverage completeness analysis
- Missing assignment identification
- Remediation recommendation engine
- Gap tracking and monitoring

## Implementation Details
### Gap Identification Components
1. **Gap Detection**: Responsibility gap identification algorithms
2. **Assignment Analysis**: Unassigned responsibility detection
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Responsibility coverage completeness assessment
4. **Missing Assignment Detection**: Stakeholder assignment gap identification
5. **Remediation Engine**: Gap remediation recommendation generation
6. **Gap Tracking**: Gap monitoring and resolution tracking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gap detection identifies responsibility gaps accurately
- [ ] Assignment analysis detects unassigned responsibilities
- [ ] Coverage analysis assesses completeness of responsibility coverage
- [ ] Missing assignment detection finds stakeholder gaps
- [ ] Remediation engine provides actionable recommendations
- [ ] Gap tracking monitors resolution progress
- [ ] Performance optimization for large responsibility sets
- [ ] Integration with matrix validation system

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Gap detection accuracy
- Assignment analysis effectiveness
- Coverage analysis correctness
- Missing assignment detection reliability
- Remediation recommendation quality

## Dependencies
- Matrix validation system
