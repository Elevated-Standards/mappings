# Create Dependency Relationship Mapping

## Overview
Implement dependency mapping system to track relationships between inherited controls, prerequisite controls, and dependent implementations. Support circular dependency detection.

## Technical Requirements
- Dependency relationship mapping
- Inherited control dependency tracking
- Prerequisite control identification
- Dependent implementation monitoring
- Circular dependency detection
- Dependency graph visualization

## Implementation Details
### Dependency Mapping Components
1. **Relationship Mapping**: Dependency relationship tracking system
2. **Control Dependencies**: Inherited control dependency management
3. **Prerequisite Tracking**: Prerequisite control identification and tracking
4. **Implementation Dependencies**: Dependent implementation monitoring
5. **Circular Detection**: Circular dependency identification and prevention
6. **Graph Visualization**: Dependency relationship visualization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Relationship mapping tracks dependencies comprehensively
- [ ] Control dependencies manage inherited control relationships
- [ ] Prerequisite tracking identifies required controls
- [ ] Implementation dependencies monitor dependent implementations
- [ ] Circular detection prevents invalid dependency cycles
- [ ] Graph visualization provides clear dependency views
- [ ] Performance optimization for complex dependency networks
- [ ] Integration with inheritance chain tracking

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Relationship mapping accuracy
- Control dependency tracking
- Prerequisite identification effectiveness
- Implementation dependency monitoring
- Circular detection reliability

## Dependencies
- Inheritance chain tracking
- Graph processing libraries
- Visualization frameworks
- Dependency analysis tools

## Estimated Effort
**20-24 hours**

## Priority
**Medium** - Dependency management functionality
