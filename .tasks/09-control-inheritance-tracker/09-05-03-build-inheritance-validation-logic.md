# Build Inheritance Validation Logic

## Overview
Create validation engine for inheritance chains including inheritance rule compliance, chain integrity checks, and inheritance conflict resolution. Ensure valid inheritance paths.

## Technical Requirements
- Inheritance validation algorithms
- Rule compliance verification
- Chain integrity checking
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Valid path verification
- Real-time validation processing

## Implementation Details
### Validation Components
1. **Validation Engine**: Inheritance chain validation algorithms
2. **Rule Compliance**: Inheritance rule verification
3. **Integrity Checks**: Chain integrity validation
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Inheritance conflict resolution
5. **Path Verification**: Valid inheritance path validation
6. **Real-time Processing**: Live validation updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validation engine ensures inheritance chain accuracy
- [ ] Rule compliance verifies inheritance rules
- [ ] Integrity checks validate chain structure
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles inheritance conflicts
- [ ] Path verification ensures valid inheritance paths
- [ ] Real-time processing maintains validation currency
- [ ] Performance optimization for large inheritance networks
- [ ] Integration with dependency relationship mapping

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Validation algorithm accuracy
- Rule compliance effectiveness
- Integrity check reliability
- Conflict resolution correctness
- Path verification validation

## Dependencies
- Dependency relationship mapping
- Inheritance rule definitions
- Conflict resolution frameworks
- Validation processing infrastructure

## Estimated Effort
**16-20 hours**

## Priority
**Medium** - Inheritance validation assurance
