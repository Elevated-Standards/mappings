# Inheritance Chain Management

## Overview
Build control inheritance chain tracking with dependency relationship management, inheritance validation, and chain impact analysis. This module manages complex inheritance relationships and their dependencies.

## Technical Requirements
- Control inheritance chain tracking
- Dependency relationship management
- Inheritance validation logic
- Chain impact analysis
- Change propagation mechanisms
- Chain visualization tools

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Inheritance Chain Tracking**: Comprehensive parent-child relationship tracking
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Prerequisite and dependent control relationships
3. **Validation Logic**: Inheritance rule compliance and integrity checks
4. **Impact Analysis**: Change effect assessment on downstream controls
5. **Change Propagation**: Automatic updates for inheritance chain changes
6. **Visualization Tools**: Interactive chain exploration and diagrams

### Chain Management Features
- Multi-level inheritance support
- Circular dependency detection
- Chain completeness validation
- Impact assessment reporting
- Rollback capabilities for changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inheritance chain tracking supports complex multi-level scenarios
