- Responsibility transfer workflows
- Change approval processes
- Impact notification system
- Change rollback capabilities
- Change history tracking

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Impact Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis of responsibility change effects
2. **Transfer Workflows**: Structured processes for responsibility transfers
3. **Approval Processes**: Multi-level approval workflows with tracking
4. **Notification System**: Automated alerts and stakeholder notifications
