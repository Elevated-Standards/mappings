# Create Compliance Gap Identification

## Overview
Implement gap identification system for compliance responsibilities including unfulfilled obligations, incomplete implementations, and missing evidence. Provide gap remediation plans.

## Technical Requirements
- Compliance gap identification algorithms
- Unfulfilled obligation detection
- Incomplete implementation identification
- Missing evidence detection
- Gap remediation planning
- Gap tracking and monitoring

## Implementation Details
### Gap Identification Components
1. **Gap Identification**: Compliance gap detection algorithms
2. **Obligation Detection**: Unfulfilled obligation identification
3. **Implementation Analysis**: Incomplete implementation detection
4. **Evidence Detection**: Missing evidence identification
5. **Remediation Planning**: Gap remediation plan generation
6. **Gap Tracking**: Gap resolution monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gap identification detects compliance gaps accurately
- [ ] Obligation detection identifies unfulfilled obligations
- [ ] Implementation analysis finds incomplete implementations
- [ ] Evidence detection identifies missing evidence
- [ ] Remediation planning provides actionable remediation plans
