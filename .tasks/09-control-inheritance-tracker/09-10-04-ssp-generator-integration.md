# SSP Generator Integration

## Overview
Integrate with SSP Generator to generate responsibility matrices for SSPs, document inheritance relationships, and include responsibility evidence in generated documents.

## Technical Requirements
- SSP Generator integration
- Responsibility matrix generation for SSPs
- Inheritance relationship documentation
- Responsibility evidence inclusion
- Document template integration
- Generation workflow automation

## Implementation Details
### Integration Components
1. **Generator Integration**: SSP Generator integration implementation
2. **Matrix Generation**: Responsibility matrix generation for SSP documents
3. **Relationship Documentation**: Inheritance relationship documentation
4. **Evidence Inclusion**: Responsibility evidence integration into documents
5. **Template Integration**: SSP document template integration
6. **Workflow Automation**: Document generation workflow automation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generator integration connects with SSP Generator successfully
- [ ] Matrix generation produces responsibility matrices for SSPs
- [ ] Relationship documentation captures inheritance relationships
- [ ] Evidence inclusion incorporates responsibility evidence
- [ ] Template integration supports SSP document templates
