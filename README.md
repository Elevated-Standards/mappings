# Security Frameworks Mappings

A comprehensive mapping system between leading security frameworks and controls including SOC 2, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, and others. This project helps organizations identify overlaps, gaps, and relationships across security frameworks to streamline compliance, reduce redundancy, and provide a unified reference for implementing and assessing security requirements.

## Features

- **Framework Mappings**: Comprehensive mappings between major security frameworks
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify gaps and overlaps between different frameworks
- **Compliance Automation**: Tools to help automate compliance assessments
- **Unified Reference**: Single source of truth for cross-framework requirements

## Supported Frameworks

- SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2)
- FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)  
- ISO 27001 (Information Security Management System)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
