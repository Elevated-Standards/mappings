# mappings

The implementation provides organizations with powerful tools to identify overlaps, gaps, and relationships across major security frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This directly addresses the need for unified compliance reference and automation improvements within organizations.

## Key Features

### Framework Support
- **SOC 2**: Complete implementation with 12 controls across 5 trust service categories (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy)
- **ISO 27001**: 14 key controls from Annex A covering essential information security management domains
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: 15 controls across the 5 core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)

### Intelligent Mapping Engine
- **Cross-framework mappings**: 11 verified control mappings with confidence scores and verification status
- **Gap analysis**: Precise coverage calculations showing, for example, that SOC 2 automatically covers 33.3% of ISO 27001 requirements
- **Similarity detection**: AI-powered text analysis to identify potential new mappings between controls
- **Compliance matrix**: Strategic overview of coverage percentages across all framework pairs
